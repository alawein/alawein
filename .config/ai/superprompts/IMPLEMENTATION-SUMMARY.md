4. **Composability** - Build complex systems from simple, reusable parts
5. **Discoverability** - Easy to find and understand systems

## Risk Mitigation

### Breaking Existing Workflows
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Create compatibility layer for old patterns
- Gradual migration with feature flags
- Comprehensive testing at each step

### Data Loss During Consolidation
- Full backup before any changes
- Version control for all changes
- Rollback procedures for each phase
- Validation checkpoints

### Developer Disruption
- Clear communication plan
- Training and documentation
- Gradual rollout to teams
- Support channels during transition

### Performance Degradation
- Performance benchmarking before/after
- Optimization during consolidation
- Monitoring and alerting
- Rollback if performance drops >10%
