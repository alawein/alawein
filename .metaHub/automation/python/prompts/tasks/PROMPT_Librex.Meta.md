## 1. Technical Specification

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Given:

- Set of solvers S = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₖ}
- Historical performance database D = {(x_i, s_j, p_ij)}ₙ where:
  - x_i: problem instance features
  - s_j: solver that was used
  - p_ij: performance metric (e.g., solution quality, runtime)
- New problem instance x\*

Objective: Select solver s* ∈ S that maximizes expected performance E[p(x*, s\*)]

### 1.2 Core Algorithm

Librex.Meta uses a Swiss-system tournament with Elo-like ratings:

    1. Feature Extractor: Extracts problem instance features
    2. Elo Tracker: Maintains solver ratings (global + per-cluster)
    3. Tournament Manager: Runs Swiss-system rounds
    4. Selection Policy: UCB-based selection with Elo priors

## 2. Research Validation

### 2.1 Novel Contribution

**META-C1: Tournament-Based Meta-Learning for Multi-Agent Solver Selection**

**Research Gap**: Existing meta-learning approaches (SATzilla, AutoFolio, SMAC) use:

- Pairwise performance prediction
- Regression-based models
- Independent solver evaluation

**Novel Approach**: Swiss-system tournament with cluster-specific Elo ratings discovers complementary solver synergies through competitive dynamics.

**Expected Impact**:

- 15-25% performance improvement over pairwise selection
- Improved generalization through tournament dynamics
- Interpretable solver rankings via Elo ratings

### 2.2 Baselines

Implement and compare against 10 state-of-the-art methods:

1. **SATzilla (2008)**: Pairwise cost-sensitive decision forests
2. **AutoFolio (2015)**: Algorithm selection via SMAC optimization
3. **SMAC (2011)**: Sequential model-based algorithm configuration
4. **Hyperband (2017)**: Bandit-based hyperparameter optimization
5. **BOHB (2018)**: Bayesian optimization + Hyperband
6. **AutoML-Zero (2020)**: Evolutionary neural architecture search
7. **Neural Algorithm Selection (2021)**: Deep learning for solver selection
8. **AlphaD3M (2021)**: Reinforcement learning for AutoML
9. **Random Forest**: Cost prediction with RF regression
10. **LinUCB**: Contextual bandit with linear features

### 2.3 Benchmark Datasets

**ASlib (Algorithm Selection Library)**: 30+ benchmark scenarios

- SAT solving: SAT11-HAND, SAT11-INDU, SAT11-RAND
- QBF solving: QBFEVAL
- CSP solving: CSP-2010
- Mixed Integer Programming: MIP instances
- Traveling Salesman: TSP instances

**Expected Performance**:

- Par10 score improvement: 20-30% over best baseline
- Selection accuracy: 70-80% (selecting top-3 solver)
- Computational overhead: <5% of solver runtime

## 4. Integration with Libria Suite

### 4.1 Libria-Core Integration

Librex.Meta extends the `LibriaSolver` base class:

```python
# libria_core/base.py
class LibriaSolver(ABC):
    """Base class for all Libria solvers"""

    @abstractmethod
    def solve(self, instance: Any) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Solve problem instance"""
        pass

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def name(self) -> str:
        """Unique solver name"""
        pass
```

### 4.2 ORCHEX Integration

Librex.Meta receives solver selection requests from ORCHEX Engine:

```python
# Example ORCHEX workflow integration
from atlas_engine import ATLASWorkflow
from libria_meta import Librex.Meta

# Initialize Librex.Meta with all Libria solvers
meta = Librex.Meta(solvers=[
    Librex.QAP(),
    Librex.Flow(),
    Librex.Alloc(),
    Librex.Graph(),
    Librex.Dual(),
    Librex.Evo()
])

# Train on historical data from ORCHEX execution logs
historical_data = load_atlas_execution_logs()
meta.fit(historical_data)

# ORCHEX workflow: Select best solver for new task
@ATLASWorkflow.register("meta_solver_selection")
def select_solver_for_task(task: Dict) -> str:
    # Extract task features
    features = extract_task_features(task)

    # Librex.Meta selects best solver
    selected_solver = meta.select_solver(task, features=features)

    # Execute selected solver
    result = selected_solver.solve(task)

    # Update Librex.Meta with performance feedback
    meta.update(task, selected_solver.name, result['objective'], features=features)

    return result
```

### 4.3 Redis Blackboard Integration

### 7.2 Paper Template

**Title**: "Tournament-Based Meta-Learning for Multi-Agent Solver Selection"

**Abstract** (250 words):

```
Meta-learning for algorithm selection has traditionally relied on pairwise
performance prediction or regression-based models that treat solvers
independently. We propose Librex.Meta, a tournament-based meta-learning
framework that discovers complementary solver synergies through competitive
dynamics. Inspired by Swiss-system tournaments in competitive games,
Librex.Meta maintains cluster-specific Elo ratings that are updated through
simulated solver matches. At inference time, Librex.Meta uses UCB-based
selection with Elo priors to balance exploitation and exploration.

We evaluate Librex.Meta on 30 benchmark scenarios from the Algorithm Selection
Library (ASlib), covering SAT solving, QBF solving, constraint satisfaction,
and mixed integer programming. Across all scenarios, Librex.Meta achieves
23% lower Par10 scores compared to SATzilla and 18% lower scores compared
to AutoFolio (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Ablation studies confirm
that both clustering and Swiss-system pairing are critical to performance,
with tournament dynamics improving generalization by 12% compared to random
pairing.

Our key insight is that treating solver selection as a competitive game
naturally captures complementary strengths: solvers that consistently beat
similar-strength opponents are more likely to generalize. Librex.Meta's
interpretable Elo rankings also provide insights into solver capabilities
across problem clusters. We release Librex.Meta as part of the open-source
Itqān Libria Suite for multi-agent optimization.

## 9. Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: AutoML Deadline (March 31, 2025)

**Mitigation**:

- Start immediately (Week 1)
- Parallel work: algorithm implementation + baseline setup
- Weekly progress reviews
- Buffer time in Week 11-12 for delays

### Risk 2: ASlib Benchmark Complexity

**Mitigation**:

- Start with subset (10 scenarios) for prototyping
- Expand to full 30 scenarios in Week 6
- Use parallel computation for evaluation

### Risk 3: Baseline Implementation Effort

**Mitigation**:

- Use existing implementations where possible (SATzilla code available)
- Focus on 5 strongest baselines if time-constrained
- Simplify baseline configurations

### Risk 4: Statistical Significance

**Mitigation**:

- Plan for 10-fold cross-validation
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired comparison
- If results marginal, expand scenarios or add problem instances
