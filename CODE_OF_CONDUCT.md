# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes, and learning from the
  experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct and will take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is
officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the
maintainer team (Meshal Alawein) via project issues or direct contact. All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

1. **Correction**: Maintainers may provide a private, written warning and require a change in
   behavior.
2. **Warning**: A formal warning with consequences for continued behavior, including temporary
   restrictions.
3. **Temporary Ban**: Temporary restriction from interaction or public communication with the
   project community.
4. **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from all project spaces.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.
