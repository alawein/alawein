# SSOT — alawein

**Version:** 1.2
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-15
**Status:** Active

---

## Purpose

Organization profile and portfolio governance source for the `@alawein` GitHub
organization. This repository is docs-only and owns the canonical workspace
governance contract for naming, portfolio truth, and migration sequencing.

## Current State

- Organization profile and documentation: ✅ Active
- Workspace operating contract:
  [`docs/governance/workspace-master-prompt.md`](docs/governance/workspace-master-prompt.md)
- Workspace batch execution contract:
  [`docs/governance/parallel-batch-execution.md`](docs/governance/parallel-batch-execution.md)
- Local documentation contract:
  [`docs/governance/documentation-contract.md`](docs/governance/documentation-contract.md)
- Governance suite navigation:
  [`docs/README-backup-20250807.md`](docs/README-backup-20250807.md)
- Canonical governance validation:
  `./scripts/validate-doc-contract.sh --full`
- Managed-doc canonical name/domain audit:
  `.github/workflows/docs-validation.yml` (with `docs/archive/**` exemption)
- Manifest-driven batch governance is active for multi-repo autonomous work
- README sections are generated from `projects.json` via
  `scripts/sync-readme.py`
- Canonical naming policy is active; hard cutover completed on 2026-03-11 for
  `gymboy`, `meatheadphysicist`, `atelier-rounaq`, and `edfp`
- Transitional identifiers are retained in `projects.json` via `legacy_slugs`
  for one migration cycle
- D-1 consolidation status: canonical token source is `devkit/tokens/`; legacy
  `aw-devkit` physical retirement cutover completed on 2026-03-11

  change
- Complete phased workspace directives (D-1 through D-5) with org README sync
  at each structural milestone
