## COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### "Nobody's watching the videos"
- [ ] Check video titles (too boring?)
- [ ] Check thumbnails (not eye-catching?)
- [ ] Are you sharing them on all platforms?
- [ ] Is the first 3 seconds hooking viewers?
- Try: Ask your guest to share the video with their followers

### "Website traffic is low"
- [ ] Is the site actually discoverable? (Google indexing?)
- [ ] Are you linking from YouTube descriptions?
- [ ] Are social posts driving traffic?
- Try: Use link shortener (bit.ly) to track which platform sends traffic

### "Getting no product sales"
- [ ] Is product photography compelling?
- [ ] Is the description selling the story or specs?
- [ ] Is there urgency? (Limited supply? Discount ending?)
- Try: First customer gets a thank you note + surprise product

### "No followers on social"
- [ ] Are you posting consistently? (Algorithm favors consistency)
- [ ] Is content valuable or just self-promotional?
- [ ] Are you engaging with others' content?
- Try: Repost user content / ask friends to share

### "Can't find interview guests"
- [ ] Who do you already know in the space?
- [ ] Who in your network knows interesting people?
- [ ] Can you start with friends/family (low pressure)?
- Try: Offer to interview them, make it fun and low-stakes

## MINDSET FOR LAUNCH

**Remember:**
1. **Done > Perfect** - Your first video won't be Hollywood quality. That's OK. It's authentic.
2. **Consistency > Quality** - Weekly mediocre content beats one great video.
3. **People > Products** - Stories and guests matter more than apparel. The merch is secondary.
4. **Brand First, Money Second** - Focus on building the brand identity first. Sales follow.
5. **Feedback Loop** - Month 1 is about learning. What works? Do more of it. What doesn't? Stop.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

This launch is about **starting**, not being perfect.

Your brand is:
- Real people (you + friend + guests you interview)
- Genuine stories (not manufactured hype)
- Beautiful products (but secondary to the brand)
- Authentic community (people who vibe with the aesthetic)

The website, YouTube, Twitch, and products are all just vehicles for telling that story.

**The launch is not the finish line. It's the beginning.**

Week 1-4 is about momentum and learning.
Months 2-6 is about optimization and scale.
Year 1 is about building a real community.

You've got this.
