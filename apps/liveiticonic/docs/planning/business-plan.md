- 2 affiliate deals per month = $500
- **Total: ~$3,500/month** at Month 12

#### 4. Community/Membership (5% - Future)

**Not launching Day 1**, but model for Year 2:

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Initial Traction
**Risk:** Nobody watches first videos
**Probability:** Medium (months 1-2)
**Mitigation:**
- Start with famous/interesting guests (borrow their audience)
- Share content aggressively with networks
- Ask early supporters to share
- Adjust content based on feedback

### Risk 2: Guest Cancellations
**Risk:** Interview guests flake
**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Confirm guests 48 hours before
- Have backup guests on standby
- Schedule 2 interviews per recording session
- Record on same day (batch content)

### Risk 3: Product Quality Issues
**Risk:** Merch arrives with problems
**Probability:** Low (with good suppliers)
**Mitigation:**
- Order samples before bulk production
- Use proven suppliers (Printful, merch by Amazon)
- Quality check process before shipping
- Easy return/refund policy

### Risk 4: Algorithm Changes
**Risk:** YouTube/TikTok algorithm shifts
**Probability:** High (always happening)
**Mitigation:**
- Build owned audience (email list)
- Don't rely on one platform
- Focus on community, not virality
- Adapt content quickly

### Risk 5: Burnout
**Risk:** Founder burnout from consistent content
**Probability:** High (common in early stage)
**Mitigation:**
- Set boundaries (2 videos/week is sustainable)
- Take planned breaks
- Outsource editing by Month 3
- Include co-founder in content creation
- Remember: It's sustainable or it's not worth it
