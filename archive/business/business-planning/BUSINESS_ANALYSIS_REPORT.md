## ⚠️ CORRECTIONS FROM MULTI-AGENT DEBATE

The original analysis incorrectly recommended deprecating/merging key assets. After deep-dive review:

| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Foundry** | Archive/deprecate       | **KEEP** - 22+ validated frameworks, pitch decks, prototypes  |
| **TalAI**      | Experimental            | **LAUNCH FIRST** - 19 products, $29-500k/mo revenue potential |
| **HELIOS**     | Merge → MEZAN           | **KEEP SEPARATE** - 20,582 LOC, unique autonomous research IP |

## 5. Immediate Action Items

### This Week

1. [ ] Check LLC name availability: "Alawein Technologies LLC" + "Repz LLC"
2. [ ] File both LLC formations ($140-300 total)
3. [ ] Get EIN from IRS (free, immediate)
4. [ ] Register domains: alawein.tech, Librex.dev, repz.app
5. [ ] Reserve GitHub: @alawein, @libria-dev

### This Month

1. [ ] Delete duplicates: TalAI (science), FitnessApp (AlaweinOS)
2. [ ] Rename: Optilibria → Librex throughout codebase

### Why Repz as Separate LLC from Day 1

- **Liability isolation** - Fitness/health claims carry legal risk
- **Clean cap table** - Consumer VCs prefer single-purpose entities
- **Different growth trajectory** - Consumer vs enterprise scaling
- **Potential acquisition target** - Easier to sell standalone
