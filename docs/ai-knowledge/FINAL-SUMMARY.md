## Executive Summary

Built a comprehensive AI knowledge management system that consolidates 67
prompts from scattered locations into a single source of truth, with advanced
features for generation, orchestration, analytics, pattern extraction, cross-IDE
sync, composition, recommendations, testing, marketplace, and adaptive learning.
