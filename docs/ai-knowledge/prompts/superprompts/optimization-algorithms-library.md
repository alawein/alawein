- Workflow design
- Pipeline optimization
- Multi-project coordination

**Team 2: Governance Agents** (compliance, policies, enforcement)

- Policy implementation
- Compliance verification
- Code owner enforcement

**Team 3: Integration Agents** (APIs, templates, connections)

- Template system
- API integrations
- Service connections

**Team 4: Infrastructure Agents** (deployment, scaling, monitoring)

- Deployment automation
- Resource management
- Performance monitoring

**Team 5: Learning Agents** (optimization, patterns, improvements)

- Workflow analysis
- Performance patterns
- Continuous improvement

### Execution Style

- ⚡ **Fast:** 2-3 sec analysis max
- 🔄 **Parallel:** All 5 teams simultaneously
- 💬 **Brief:** Update with ✅/🔧/⚠️ only
- 📊 **Metrics:** Throughput, compliance, cost
- 🧠 **Smart:** Sequential thinking for complex orchestration only
