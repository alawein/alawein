# ADR-0001: Use Architecture Decision Records

**Date:** 2025-12-04

---

## Status

**Accepted**

---

## Context

As the repository grows in complexity with multiple subsystems (ORCHEX, AI
orchestration, governance automation), we need a structured way to document
significant architectural decisions. Current challenges include:

- Architectural decisions are scattered across commit messages, PR discussions,
  and Slack
- New team members struggle to understand why certain approaches were chosen
- Historical context is lost when contributors leave
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered are not documented
- No clear process for reviewing architectural changes

The team needs a lightweight, version-controlled method to:

- Capture the rationale behind important decisions
- Document alternatives that were considered
- Track the evolution of architectural thinking
- Provide context for future refactoring decisions
- Enable asynchronous review of architectural proposals

---

## Decision

We will use **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** to document all significant
architectural decisions in this repository.

**Key principles:**

1. **Location:** Store ADRs in `docs/architecture/decisions/` directory
2. **Format:** Use markdown files with a standardized template
3. **Naming:** Sequential numbering: `NNNN-short-title.md` (e.g.,
   `0001-use-adr.md`)
4. **Process:** Create ADRs through pull requests with team review
5. **Scope:** Document decisions that are hard to reverse or significantly
   impact the project
6. **Lifecycle:** ADRs can be Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded

**What to document:**

- Technology choices (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Architectural patterns (monorepo structure, CLI design)
- Development practices (testing strategy, CI/CD)
- Infrastructure decisions (deployment, monitoring)
- Security architecture (auth, secrets management)

**What NOT to document:**

- Implementation details (those go in code comments or docs)
- Trivial decisions (use good judgment)
- Project management decisions (those go in project docs)

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Continue Using GitHub Issues

**Description:** Document architectural decisions in GitHub issues with an
"architecture" label

**Pros:**

- Already using GitHub
- Good for discussion and collaboration
- Searchable

**Cons:**

- Issues are focused on problems, not decisions
- Hard to find historical context
- No standardized format
- Discussion threads can become cluttered
- Not version controlled with code

**Why not chosen:** Issues are great for discussions but lack the structure and
permanence needed for architectural documentation.

### Option 2: Use Wiki or Notion

**Description:** Maintain architectural documentation in a wiki or external tool
like Notion

**Pros:**

- Rich formatting and organization
- Easy to edit and update
- Good search capabilities

**Cons:**

- Not version controlled with code
- Requires separate tool/login
- Can become stale or out of sync
- Not part of code review process
- External dependency

**Why not chosen:** We want architectural decisions to be version controlled
alongside the code and reviewed through the same PR process.

### Option 3: RFC Process (like Rust, Ember)

**Description:** Formal RFC (Request for Comments) process with lengthy
proposals

**Pros:**

- Thorough and comprehensive
- Strong community involvement
- Well-defined process

**Cons:**

- Too heavyweight for our team size
- Long decision cycles
- Requires significant time investment
- Overkill for many decisions

**Why not chosen:** A full RFC process is too formal for a small team. ADRs
provide the right balance of structure and simplicity.

### Option 4: No Formal Process

**Description:** Continue documenting decisions informally in commits, PRs, and
discussions

**Pros:**

- No process overhead
- Maximum flexibility
- Low barrier to contribution

**Cons:**

- Context gets lost over time
- Inconsistent documentation
- Hard to find historical decisions
- New team members lack context
- Difficult to review architectural changes

**Why not chosen:** This is our current state and the pain points are real. We
need more structure.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- ✅ **Institutional memory:** Architectural context is preserved even when team
  members leave
- ✅ **Better onboarding:** New contributors can understand why things are the
  way they are
- ✅ **Thoughtful decisions:** Writing an ADR forces careful consideration of
  alternatives
- ✅ **Asynchronous review:** Team members can review and discuss proposals on
  their schedule
- ✅ **Traceability:** Can track how architectural thinking evolved over time
- ✅ **Reduced debates:** Past decisions are documented, reducing recurring
  discussions
- ✅ **Version controlled:** ADRs live with the code and follow the same review
  process

### Negative Consequences

- ⚠️ **Process overhead:** Writing ADRs takes time upfront
  - _Mitigation:_ Use template to make writing faster; only document significant
    decisions
- ⚠️ **Maintenance burden:** ADRs can become stale if architecture changes
  - _Mitigation:_ Mark outdated ADRs as Superseded or Deprecated rather than
    deleting
- ⚠️ **Learning curve:** Team needs to learn ADR format and process
  - _Mitigation:_ Provide clear template, examples, and documentation
- ⚠️ **May slow down decisions:** Formal documentation adds friction
  - _Mitigation:_ Keep ADRs lightweight (1-2 pages); accept "good enough" over
    perfect

### Neutral Consequences

- ℹ️ ADRs require discipline to maintain but benefit grows over time
- ℹ️ Not all decisions need ADRs; team judgment determines what's significant
- ℹ️ ADRs complement (don't replace) other documentation like README and inline
  comments

## Implementation Notes

**Immediate actions:**

1. Create `docs/architecture/decisions/` directory
2. Add ADR template (`0000-template.md`)
3. Document this decision as `0001-use-adr-for-architecture-decisions.md`
4. Update CODEOWNERS to require review for ADR changes

**Ongoing practices:**

- When making significant architectural decisions, create an ADR first
- Review ADRs in pull requests with at least one approval
- Update status of ADRs when they're superseded
- Reference ADRs in code comments where relevant

**Success metrics:**

- All major architectural decisions documented in 2025
- ADRs referenced during onboarding and code reviews
- Team finds ADRs useful for understanding project evolution
