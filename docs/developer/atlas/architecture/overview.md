# System Architecture Overview

High-level overview of the ORCHEX system architecture, including core
components, data flow, and integration patterns.

---

## System Purpose and Goals

ORCHEX (Autonomous Technical Leadership & Adaptive System) is an
enterprise-grade multiagent LLM orchestration platform designed to:

- **🤖 Intelligent Agent Routing**: Automatically select optimal AI agents based
  on task requirements, performance history, and current load
- **🛡️ Resilient Execution**: Multi-tier fallback chains ensure task completion
  even when primary agents fail
- **🔄 Continuous Optimization**: Automated repository analysis and refactoring
  to reduce technical debt
- **📊 Enterprise Observability**: Comprehensive telemetry, metrics, and audit
  trails for governance and compliance

---

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration

ORCHEX orchestrates multiple AI agents (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.) with
intelligent routing based on:

- Task type and complexity
- Agent capabilities and performance history
- Cost efficiency and availability
- Quality requirements and constraints

### 2. Resilience Through Fallback

Three-tier fallback system ensures reliability:

- **Primary Agent**: First-choice agent for the task
- **Secondary Agent**: Backup agent with similar capabilities
- **Tertiary Agent**: Final fallback with broader capabilities
- **Human Escalation**: Manual intervention when all automated attempts fail

### 3. Continuous Learning and Optimization

System improves over time through:

- Performance tracking and analysis
- Routing model refinement
- Automated repository optimization
- Quality metric collection and analysis

### 4. Enterprise Integration

Built on KILO foundation with:

- Governance and compliance validation
- DevOps automation integration
- Enterprise security and audit capabilities
- Multi-repository management support
