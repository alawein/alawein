# Assessment Phase: Evaluating Current KILO Usage and Integration Opportunities

## Overview

The assessment phase is the foundation of a successful ORCHEX-KILO migration.
This phase involves systematically evaluating your current KILO implementation,
understanding team workflows, and identifying the most valuable integration
points for ORCHEX capabilities.

## Assessment Objectives

- **Current State Analysis**: Understand existing KILO usage patterns and
  effectiveness
- **Integration Opportunities**: Identify workflows that would benefit most from
  ORCHEX integration
- **Risk Identification**: Assess potential challenges and mitigation strategies
- **Resource Planning**: Determine team readiness and training needs
- **Success Metrics Baseline**: Establish current performance benchmarks

## Assessment Tools and Scripts

```

### 2. Usage Pattern Analysis Script

Analyze how KILO is currently being used across your organization:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# analyze-usage-patterns.sh
# Analyze current KILO and ORCHEX usage patterns

OUTPUT_DIR="./assessment-reports"
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

echo "Analyzing usage patterns..."

# Analyze ORCHEX usage (if available)
if command -v ORCHEX &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Gathering ORCHEX analysis history..."
    ORCHEX analyze repo . --format json --output "$OUTPUT_DIR/ORCHEX-current-analysis.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "ORCHEX analysis failed"
fi

# Analyze KILO policies
if command -v kilo &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Gathering KILO policy information..."
    kilo policy list --format json > "$OUTPUT_DIR/kilo-policies.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "KILO policy list failed"

    echo "Analyzing compliance status..."
    kilo compliance check . --format json > "$OUTPUT_DIR/kilo-compliance-current.json" 2>/dev/null || echo "KILO compliance check failed"
fi

# Analyze CI/CD pipelines
echo "Analyzing CI/CD pipelines..."
find . -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" | xargs grep -l "ORCHEX\|kilo" > "$OUTPUT_DIR/cicd-integration-files.txt" 2>/dev/null || true

# Analyze team workflows (basic)
echo "Analyzing development workflows..."
find . -name "README*" -o -name "CONTRIBUTING*" -o -name "*.md" | head -5 | xargs grep -i "workflow\|process\|development" > "$OUTPUT_DIR/workflow-references.txt" 2>/dev/null || true

# Generate summary report
cat > "$OUTPUT_DIR/assessment-summary.md" << EOF
# ORCHEX-KILO Integration Assessment Summary
