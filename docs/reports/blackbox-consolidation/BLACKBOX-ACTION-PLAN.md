   - Design centralized library
   - Plan versioning system
   - Plan discovery system

3. Use CONFIG-UNIFICATION.md
   - Design unified configuration
   - Plan inheritance system
   - Plan environment overrides

4. Use GOVERNANCE-CONSOLIDATION.md
   - Design governance framework
   - Plan policy hierarchy
   - Plan enforcement system

5. Use CICD-PIPELINE-UNIFICATION.md
   - Design pipeline engine
   - Plan composition framework
   - Plan execution system

**Deliverable**: System design documents for each of 8 systems

### Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 4-7)
**Objective**: Execute consolidation incrementally

**Actions**:
1. Use INCREMENTAL-REFACTORING-PLAN.md
   - Prioritize refactoring targets
   - Plan incremental steps
   - Define validation points

2. Use MIGRATION-STRATEGY.md
   - Plan migration phases
   - Define approach
   - Plan rollback procedures

3. Use TESTING-STRATEGY.md
   - Plan test coverage
   - Define test execution
   - Plan validation

4. Execute consolidation:
   - Start with highest-priority items
   - Validate each step
   - Monitor progress
   - Adjust plan as needed

**Deliverable**: Consolidated systems for each of 8 systems

### Phase 4: Validation (Week 8)
**Objective**: Verify success

**Actions**:
1. Use VALIDATION-CHECKPOINTS.md
   - Validate each checkpoint
   - Measure metrics
   - Verify functionality

2. Verify success criteria:
   - [ ] All functionality preserved
   - [ ] 40%+ file reduction
   - [ ] 80%+ configuration centralization
   - [ ] <5% code duplication
   - [ ] 100% test coverage maintained
   - [ ] Build time reduced by 50%
   - [ ] Developer satisfaction >8/10
   - [ ] Zero data loss

**Deliverable**: Validation report with metrics

### Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (Week 9+)
**Objective**: Deploy and monitor

**Actions**:
1. Deploy consolidated systems
2. Monitor for issues
3. Gather feedback
4. Document lessons learned
5. Plan ongoing maintenance

**Deliverable**: Deployed systems with monitoring
