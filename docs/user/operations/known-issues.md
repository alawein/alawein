## Resolved Issues

### 1. Vitest Test Discovery Failure

**Status:** ✅ **Resolved** - 2025-12-04 **Resolution:** Downgraded from Vitest
4.0.15 to 3.2.4

**Original Issue:** Vitest 4.0.15 failed to discover test suites with error: "No
test suite found in file". All 18 test files were affected, making the entire
test suite non-functional.

**Root Cause:** Vitest 4.x has a regression or compatibility issue with Windows
path resolution and/or TypeScript `moduleResolution: "bundler"` configuration.

**Solution:**

```bash
npm install -D vitest@3.2.4
```

**Result:**

- ✅ All 241 tests passing across 18 test files
- ✅ Test execution time: ~14 seconds
- ✅ CI/CD tests restored to working state

**Recommendation:** Do not upgrade to Vitest 4.x until the Windows compatibility
issue is resolved upstream. Monitor
[Vitest releases](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/releases) for a fix.
