## A

### ARPU
**Average Revenue Per User**

Calculation: Total Revenue ÷ Number of Users

Example: If you have 100 users and make $500/month, ARPU = $5/user

Why it matters: Tells you how much money each user generates on average. Higher is better.

Related: MRR, LTV, CAC

---

### Assumptions
**Things you believe to be true but haven't validated**

Example: "Students will pay $99/month for this" (assumption) vs "5 students agreed to pre-pay $99" (validated)

Why it matters: Assumptions are dangerous. Validation turns assumptions into facts.

Related: Validation, Pivot

---

## B

### Beta Users / Beta Testing
**Early users who test product before public launch**

Who: Usually 10-50 early adopters or pre-sale customers

What they do: Use product, give feedback, identify bugs

Why it matters: Real users find problems you didn't anticipate. Makes launch smoother.

Related: MVP, Pre-sales, Product-Market Fit

---

### Burn Rate
**How fast you spend money**

Calculation: Monthly Expenses

Example: If you spend $5K/month and have $50K in the bank, you'll run out in 10 months

Why it matters: Tells you how long you can operate. Need revenue before money runs out.

Related: Runway, Profitability

---

## C

### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
**How much it costs to acquire one customer**

Calculation: Total Marketing Spend ÷ New Customers Acquired

Example: Spend $1,000 on ads, get 10 customers = $100 CAC

Why it matters: If CAC > LTV, you'll never be profitable. Should be CAC < LTV/3

Related: LTV, Unit Economics, Payback Period

---

### Churn Rate / Churn
**Percentage of customers who cancel/leave each month**

Calculation: (Customers Lost ÷ Customers at Month Start) × 100

Example: Started with 100 users, 5 cancelled = 5% churn

Good churn: <5% monthly | Bad churn: >10% monthly

Why it matters: Even great growth looks bad if churn is high. Retention = survival.

Related: Retention, Payback Period

---

### Cohort Analysis
**Grouping users by signup month to track their behavior over time**

Example: "Users from January have 40% retention after 3 months"

Why it matters: Shows if retention is improving. Identifies patterns in user behavior.

Related: Retention, Churn

---

### Conversion Rate
**Percentage of people who take desired action**

Examples:
- 10% of website visitors sign up = 10% conversion rate
- 20% of signups become paid = 20% conversion rate

Why it matters: 1% improvement in conversion = huge impact on revenue.

Related: Funnel, CAC

---

## D

### DAU (Daily Active Users)
**Number of unique users who engage with product daily**

Example: Day 1 = 50 DAU | Day 2 = 75 DAU | Day 3 = 60 DAU

Why it matters: Shows product is sticky. Users coming back.

Related: MAU, Engagement, Retention

---

### Default Mode
**What happens if you don't make any changes**

Example: If 50 businesses fail, default mode = you fail too

Why it matters: Reminds you that doing nothing = failure. Change is necessary.

Related: Pivot, Iteration

---

## F

### Funnel / Sales Funnel
**Steps customers take to become paying users**

Example:
```
1000 Visit Website
  ↓ (60% convert)
600 Sign Up
  ↓ (50% convert)
300 Try Free Trial
  ↓ (40% convert)
120 Become Paying
```

Why it matters: Tells you where people drop off. Optimize each step.

Related: Conversion Rate, CAC

---

## G

### Go-to-Market Strategy
**How you'll reach and acquire customers**

Example: "We'll launch on Product Hunt, then build community, then paid ads"

Includes: Marketing, sales, partnerships, distribution strategy

Why it matters: Great product + bad go-to-market = failure. Both matter.

Related: Growth Strategy, Marketing Plan

---

## I

### Iteration
**Small changes and improvements based on feedback**

Example: User feedback = "It's too complicated" → Simplify UI → Collect feedback → Repeat

Why it matters: Perfection is impossible. Quick iteration beats slow perfection.

Related: Pivot, Feedback Loop, MVP

---

## J

### Jobs-to-be-Done
**The underlying job your customer is trying to accomplish**

Example:
- Job: "Help me get better at public speaking"
- Solution could be: App, coach, course, community, etc.

Why it matters: Focus on the job, not the solution. Understand the real need.

Related: Problem Definition, Value Proposition

---

## K

### Key Metrics
**The 3-5 numbers that matter most for your business**

Example for SaaS:
1. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
3. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
4. Churn Rate
5. Growth Rate

Why it matters: Obsess over the right metrics. Wrong metrics = wrong decisions.

Related: Metrics Dashboard, KPI

---

## L

### LTV (Lifetime Value)
**Total profit you'll make from one customer**

Calculation: (Average Monthly Revenue per User × Average Customer Lifetime) - CAC

Example: Customer pays $99/month for 12 months before canceling = $1,188 LTV

Why it matters: If LTV < CAC, you'll never be profitable. LTV should be 3-5x CAC.

Related: CAC, Unit Economics, Payback Period

---

### Launch
**Going public / making product available to non-beta users**

Before launch: Private, limited users, iterating heavily

After launch: Public, anyone can use, customer support required

Why it matters: Huge milestone. Scary and exciting.

Related: MVP, Public Launch, Go-to-Market

---

## M

### MAU (Monthly Active Users)
**Unique users who engage at least once in a month**

Example: App has 1,000 MAU = 1,000 different people used it this month

Why it matters: Shows user base size. More reliable than DAU for evaluating growth.

Related: DAU, Engagement, Retention

---

Why it matters: Get feedback fast. Don't build features you're not sure about.

Related: Iteration, Beta Testing, Product-Market Fit

---

### MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
**Predictable revenue you receive each month**

Calculation: (Number of Paid Users) × (Average Monthly Price)

Example: 100 users at $99/month = $9,900 MRR

Why it matters: Most important metric for SaaS. Shows business health.

Related: ARPU, ARR, Revenue Growth

Bad onboarding: New user confused, leaves in <2 minutes

Why it matters: First impression = critical. Bad onboarding kills growth.

Related: User Experience, Product-Market Fit

---

## P

### Pivot
**Change fundamental approach based on learnings**

Examples:
- Change target customer (researchers → students)
- Change product features (interview tool → community)
- Change business model (subscription → freemium)

Why it matters: Validation fails → you don't build wrong thing for 6 months

Related: Validation, Iteration, Assumption

---

### Pre-Sales
**Collecting payment before you ship product**

Example: During validation, 10 people agree to pay $99 after you ship

Why it matters: Proves people will actually pay. Not just interest, but commitment.

Related: Validation, MVP Launch

Signs:
- Users can't live without you
- Organic word-of-mouth growth
- 10%+ month-over-month growth
- Low churn (<5%)
- High NPS (>50)

Why it matters: Most important milestone. Before this = survival. After this = growth.

Related: Validation, Growth, Scale

---

### Profitability
**When revenue > expenses**

Break-even point: When revenue = expenses

Why it matters: Without profitability, you eventually run out of money.

Related: Unit Economics, Burn Rate, Runway

---

## R

### Retention
**Percentage of customers who stay**

Calculation: (Users Still Here ÷ Users at Start) × 100

Example: Start with 100 users, 95 still here after 1 month = 95% retention

Good retention: >90% monthly | Bad retention: <85% monthly

Why it matters: Retention is easier than acquisition. Happy users = growth.

Related: Churn, Cohort Analysis, CAC

---

### Revenue Model
**How your business makes money**

Examples:
- SaaS subscription

Related: Target Market, Positioning

---

## T

### Target Customer / Target Market
**Specific people you're building for**

Example: "Small research teams at top 100 US universities"

Specificity matters. Vague = failure. Specific = focus.

Why it matters: Clear target = better product, better marketing, better sales.

Related: Segment, Personas, Value Proposition

---

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
**Total revenue available if you captured 100% of market**

Example: If there are 100,000 researchers and each pays $100/year = $10M TAM

Why it matters: Shows business potential. Bigger TAM = more venture capital interest.

Related: Market Size, SAM, SOM

---

## U

### Unit Economics
**Revenue and costs at the customer level**

Example:
- Price: $99/month
- COGS: $10/month (cost to serve)
- Gross Margin: $89/month
- CAC: $200 (marketing cost)
- Payback Period: 2.25 months

Why it matters: If unit economics don't work, scaling makes it worse.

Related: CAC, LTV, Profitability, Pricing

## V

### Validation
**Proving assumptions are correct before building**

Validation process:
1. Talk to 20 people
2. Ask deep questions about problem

1. Week 1-2: Identify problem (talk to 20 users)
2. Week 2-3: Show solution (mockups)
3. Week 3-4: Get pre-sales (collect payment)
4. Week 4: Decide GO/PIVOT/STOP

Why it matters: Prevents building something nobody wants. Saves 6 months.

Related: Validation, Lean Startup, MVP

---

### Value Proposition
**Reason customer should buy your product instead of alternatives**

Example: "Get research feedback in minutes, not weeks"
