# START HERE - ORCHEX Startup Kit

**A complete, validated framework for building a profitable AI research platform.**

---

## The 30-Second Truth

**What:** Validate and build AI-powered research tools (ONE at a time)
**Timeline:** 4 weeks to validate → 24 weeks to build if validated
**Investment:** $500 to validate → $50K to build (if validated)
**Your outcome:** Either a profitable SaaS or saved 6 months of wasted effort

**Key insight:** 95% of startups fail because they build something nobody wants. This framework ensures you validate first.

---

## CRITICAL: Read This First

### Before You Do ANYTHING:

**1. Read:** `docs/guides/VALIDATION_FIRST.md` (15 min) ← **MOST IMPORTANT**

This shows you how to validate demand in 4 weeks for under $500:
- Week 1: Interview 10 potential users
- Week 2: Show mockups, validate solution
- Week 3: Get 10+ people to pre-pay $99
- Week 4: GO/PIVOT/STOP decision

**If you skip validation, you have a 95% chance of failure.**

**2. Read:** `docs/audits/COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT.md` (10 min)

Brutal assessment of what was wrong with the original plan:
- Grade: C+ (72/100)
- Why the 16-week/3-product plan was unrealistic
- What changed in the new approach

## Choose Your Path

### Path 1: Ready to Validate (START HERE) ⭐

**→ Read:** `docs/guides/VALIDATION_FIRST.md` (15 min)
**→ Then do:** Week 1 validation tasks

## The Business Reality

### OLD Plan (Unrealistic):
```
❌ Timeline: 16 weeks to 3 products
❌ Investment: $115K → $1.56M ARR in 12 months
❌ Problem: NO VALIDATION - 95% chance of failure
```

### NEW Plan (Realistic):
```
✅ Week 1-4: VALIDATE ($500)
   Goal: 10+ pre-sales = $990 revenue BEFORE building

✅ Week 5-28: BUILD MVP if validated ($50K)
   Goal: 50-100 users, $3-5K MRR

✅ Week 29-52: SCALE
   Goal: 200-500 users, $10-20K MRR

✅ Month 18: Mature Product
   Goal: $50-100K MRR
```

**Translation:** Validate for $500 → If validated, invest $50K → Build to $100K ARR in 18 months

---

## Critical Mindset Shift

### ❌ OLD APPROACH (95% Fail):
Build → Hope → Fail

### ✅ NEW APPROACH (50% Success):
Validate → Build → Succeed (or fail fast and cheap)

---

## Success Milestones

### Week 4 (End of Validation)
- [ ] 20+ user interviews conducted
- [ ] 70%+ identified consistent pain
- [ ] 10+ pre-sales at $99 ($990+ revenue)
- [ ] **DECISION:** GO / PIVOT / STOP

**→ If <10 pre-sales: PIVOT or STOP (saved 6 months)**
**→ If 10+ pre-sales: Build it**

### Week 12 (After 8 Weeks Building - IF VALIDATED)
- [ ] MVP works end-to-end
- [ ] All 10 pre-sale customers using it
- [ ] Getting daily feedback
- [ ] **Outcome:** Product-market fit signals

### Week 28 (PUBLIC LAUNCH)
- [ ] 50+ paying customers
- [ ] $5-10K MRR
- [ ] **Outcome:** Real market validation

### Week 52 (End of Year 1)
- [ ] 200-500 users
- [ ] $10-20K MRR
- [ ] Positive unit economics
- [ ] **Decision:** Scale to $100K MRR or pivot

## The 10 Product Ideas

### NEW APPROACH: One at a Time
**Start with ONE. Validate it. Build it. Get to $10K MRR. Then consider #2.**

### Phase 1: Start Here
1. **Nightmare Mode** - AI attacks papers from 6 angles (Feasibility: 9/10, Impact: 9/10)

**Validation:** Month 1 (4 weeks)
- Interview 20 researchers
- Show mockups
- Get 10+ pre-sales at $99

**Build:** Months 2-6 (20 weeks)
- Ship to pre-sale customers
- Iterate based on feedback
- Reach 50-100 users

**Scale:** Months 7-12 (24 weeks)
- Public launch
- Target: $10-20K MRR, 200-500 users

**→ Decision at Month 12: Scale to $100K MRR? Or validate Product #2?**

### Future Products (ONLY if #1 succeeds):
2. Chaos Engine - Cross-domain hypothesis generator
3. Research Prison - 200-question interrogation
4-10. Various research tools

**Reality:** Most companies never get past 2-3 products. That's OK.

## Reality Check

### You Should Validate If:
✅ You can commit 20 hours/week for 4 weeks
✅ You can handle hearing "no"
✅ You're willing to pivot based on data
✅ You want to avoid wasting 6 months

### You Should Build (After Validation) If:
✅ You got 10+ pre-sales
✅ You can commit 40-60 hours/week for 6 months
✅ You can afford to invest $50K
✅ You're excited about this problem

### You Should NOT Do This If:
❌ You want to skip validation and "just build"
❌ You're not willing to talk to users
❌ You give up when things get hard
❌ You want quick/easy money

**Success rate WITH validation:** ~10% (10x better than average)
**Success rate WITHOUT validation:** ~1% (industry average)

## Your Next Action (Right Now)

### If You Haven't Validated Yet:
```
1. Read docs/guides/VALIDATION_FIRST.md (15 min)
2. Make list of 50 potential interviewees (30 min)
3. Send 10 emails asking for interviews TODAY
4. Schedule first interview for tomorrow
```

**DO NOT skip to building. Validation comes first.**

---

### If You've Validated (10+ Pre-Sales):
```
1. Email all pre-sale customers with timeline
2. Read IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (30 min)
3. Run setup commands:
   cd scripts/
   ./create-repo.sh nightmare-mode ORCHEX-nightmare-validator
4. Start Week 1 build plan
```

**You've earned the right to build. Now ship fast.**

---

### If Validation Failed (<5 Pre-Sales):
```
1. STOP building this version
2. Analyze why it failed
3. PIVOT: Change one variable
4. Repeat validation with new approach
```

**Failure in validation = success. You just saved 6 months.**
