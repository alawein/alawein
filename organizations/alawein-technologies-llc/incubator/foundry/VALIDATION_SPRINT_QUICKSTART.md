## 💡 REMEMBER

- You're not selling anything
- You're just asking questions
- You're looking for PROBLEMS they mention
- You're watching REACTIONS to your pitch
- You're listening for PRICE signals (would they pay?)

Score these 3 signals in each call:
1. **Problem:** Do they say this is a real problem? (+2 yes, 0 maybe, -1 no)
2. **Solution:** Would they use this? (+2 yes, +1 maybe, 0 no)
3. **Price:** Would they pay? (+2 yes $50+, +1 maybe, -1 free only)

**Total per call:** -3 to +6

**Good signal:** Average 4+ across calls for an idea = GO DEEP

---

## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: What if someone asks detailed technical questions?**
A: You don't have all answers. Be honest. "That's a great question, that's why I'm validating first."

**Q: What if they're not interested?**
A: That's GOOD data. Score honestly. That signal matters.

**Q: Should I explain the whole idea in detail?**
A: No. Quick 30-second pitch. Then watch reaction. Then ask questions.

**Q: What if I can't get 15 people?**
A: Do your best. Even 10 quality interviews gives you signal. Go deeper with whoever responds.

**Q: How do I score if they're lukewarm?**
A: Use middle scores. Not everyone will be enthusiastic. Average matters more than any single call.

**Q: Should I offer anything to get them to respond?**
A: No. People are generally helpful if you're genuine. Just be direct: "5 min of your thoughts would be really valuable."

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 3 WEEKS

**IF you have a clear winner (20+ points):**
- Pick that idea
- Move to 4-week deep validation
- Prepare to build MVP

**IF you have two strong ideas (both 18+):**
- Pick the higher scoring one OR test both
- Do deeper validation
- Make build decision

**IF all three are weak (under 15 points):**
- This is okay! You learned what doesn't work
- Pick different idea from the other 7
- Start new validation sprint
- Much faster to learn this than build wrong thing

**Either way: You have REAL DATA from real customers, not guesses.**
