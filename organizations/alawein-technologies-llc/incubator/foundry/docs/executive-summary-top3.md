## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Start all three in parallel with staggered launches:**

1. **Week 4:** Ghost Researcher soft launch (beta)
2. **Week 6:** Scientific Tinder viral launch
3. **Week 10:** Chaos Engine enterprise pilots

This maximizes speed while maintaining quality. The $450K investment pays back within 8 months with projected $250K MRR by Month 6.

Ghost Researcher is the safest bet with clearest path to revenue. Scientific Tinder is the growth rocket with viral potential. Chaos Engine is the enterprise whale hunter with highest LTV.

**Together, they form a research innovation suite that could dominate the future of scientific discovery.**
