## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Build Ghost Researcher first, Scientific Tinder second, with Chaos Engine as the moonshot.**

Ghost Researcher represents the optimal combination of immediate market need (9/10 customer pain score), technical feasibility (7/10), and revenue potential (9/10). The research community is desperately seeking AI assistance that maintains academic rigor while accelerating discovery. With a clear path to $100K MRR within 6 months and relatively low technical risk, this should be the primary focus, consuming 50% of resources.

Scientific Tinder should launch simultaneously but with lighter investment (30% of resources), leveraging its viral potential (10/10) and quick time to MVP (10/10). The network effects make early launch critical - even a basic version can start building the community while Ghost Researcher generates revenue. The $125K budget and 4-person team can deliver a compelling MVP that grows organically through academic networks. Timeline to first revenue is 8 weeks with the freemium model converting at 5% to paid subscriptions.

Chaos Engine represents the highest risk but potentially highest reward (20% of resources initially). Its unique position in experimental design could capture the enterprise pharma market worth billions, but requires careful development to avoid safety issues. Consider this the R&D project that could become the main product if early results are promising.

**Total capital needed to win:** $450,000 for parallel development, or $300,000 for sequential approach focusing on Ghost Researcher first with early revenue funding the others. Expected break-even at Month 5 with combined MRR of $50,000+ across all three products.
