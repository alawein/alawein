- [ ] Schedule "what's next" meeting with team
- [ ] Celebrate! (You've accomplished something most startups skip!)

**Decision Tree:**
```
If 10+ pre-sales & 70%+ identified problem → GO BUILD
If 5-10 pre-sales & learnings → PIVOT (change one variable)
If <5 pre-sales → STOP (or pivot drastically)
```

**→ If GO: Proceed to PHASE 2**
**→ If PIVOT: Go back to Week 1 with changes**
**→ If STOP: Excellent! You saved 6 months. Pick another idea.**
