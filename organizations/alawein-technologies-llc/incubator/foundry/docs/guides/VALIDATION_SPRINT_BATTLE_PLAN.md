# 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### Minimum success (go proceed):
- ✅ 15 interviews completed
- ✅ Clear winner identified (20+ points)
- ✅ 5+ people said "yes I'd use this"
- ✅ 2+ people willing to pay
- ✅ Clear problem articulation

### Excellent success:
- ✅ 20 interviews completed
- ✅ Multiple strong signals (2 ideas 18+ points)
- ✅ 8+ people said "yes"
- ✅ 4+ people willing to pay
- ✅ Can pitch confidently from customer feedback

---

# ⚠️ WHAT COULD GO WRONG

**Problem: Can't get people on calls**
- Solution: Use LinkedIn, ask for referrals aggressively, offer different time slots
- Fallback: Do async text interviews (send script, get written responses)

**Problem: People not interested in any idea**
- Solution: Maybe it's the pitch angle. Pivot the concept. Test different customer segment.
- Fallback: This is still valuable learning - it's a "validated invalid" idea

**Problem: All three ideas look equally good**
- Solution: Go deeper into one. Pick winner by:
  - Largest market size (how many potential customers?)
  - Best price signal (who'd pay most?)
  - Most customer enthusiasm (gut feel)

**Problem: No clear pattern after 15 interviews**
- Solution: Interview 5 more (total 20). Keep going until signal is clear.

# 🚀 EXECUTION MINDSET

This is a 3-week sprint. The goal is **DATA, not perfection.**

- ✅ Messy interviews are fine
- ✅ Not every script will be perfect
- ✅ Some calls will be awkward
- ✅ That's all normal

What matters:
- You talk to 15+ people
- You score them honestly
- You extract the truth
- You make a decision
