# 🚀 COPY-PASTE READY: OUTREACH EMAILS

## EMAIL TEMPLATE 1: Research Prison (Academic Researchers)

**Subject:** 5-min feedback on research validation tool?

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I'm testing a tool that might interest someone doing rigorous research like you.

**The idea:** You submit a hypothesis. An AI interrogator grills it with 200+ tough questions (statistical, methodological, logical) until it either breaks or proves itself. Think brutal peer review on steroids, but instant.

Would you be open to 5 minutes of feedback? Just want to know:
1. Is this something you'd ever use?
2. What's missing from peer review right now?

No pitch, just learning.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: Nightmare Mode (Researchers)

**Subject:** Quick question about peer review feedback

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

I'm working on something that might be relevant to your research.

**Quick concept:** An AI that provides brutal, rigorous feedback on your hypothesis from 200+ angles (stats, methodology, ethics, logic) - not polite, just honest. It's like having access to the harshest possible reviewers instantly.

Would you have 5 minutes to tell me:
1. What's missing from your current peer review process?
2. Would you ever pay for instant, rigorous feedback?

Genuinely just validating if this resonates.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## EMAIL TEMPLATE 3: Chaos Engine (Innovation/R&D)

**Subject:** Novel idea generation tool feedback?

**Body:**
Hi [Name],

Quick question for someone in your role.

**The idea:** A tool that randomly collides unrelated research domains to generate novel hypotheses. Physics × poetry. Game theory × mycology. Most are nonsense (95%), but 1% are genius breakthroughs.

Given your work on [their domain], would this be useful for discovering novel research directions?

I have 5 minutes of questions if you're open to it.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
