# ⚡ ULTRA-QUICK VALIDATION SCRIPTS (5 MINUTES)

Use these word-for-word. Time each question. Move fast.

---

## SCRIPT 1: Research Prison (5 min call)

**OPENING (30 sec)**
"Thanks for taking time. Quick context - I'm testing if researchers want instant, brutal hypothesis validation from AI. Just want your honest gut reaction."

**DISCOVERY (2 min)**
"When you're validating a hypothesis or paper, what's the biggest frustration? [Listen for: slow peer review, soft feedback, lack of rigor, waiting months]"

**PITCH (1 min)**
"So imagine: you submit your hypothesis. An AI grills it with tough questions - statistical holes, methodological flaws, contradictions, ethical issues. It doesn't stop until your idea either breaks or survives. Would that be useful?"

**SIGNAL CHECK (1.5 min)**
- "Gut reaction - would you use this?" [Yes/No/Maybe]
- "What would you pay monthly for this?" [Listen to price: free, $10-50, $50+]
- "Who else should I talk to?" [Get 1 referral]

**CLOSE (30 sec)**
"Thanks, super helpful."

## SCRIPT 2: Nightmare Mode (5 min call)

**OPENING (30 sec)**
"Thanks for taking time. Testing an idea about peer review. Want your honest gut reaction."

**DISCOVERY (2 min)**
"What's missing from peer review process right now?" [Listen for: slow, not rigorous enough, too polite, lack of depth]

**PITCH (1 min)**
"What if you could get brutal, aggressive peer review from AI - like the harshest possible critic, but instantly. Multiple angles: statistical, methodological, logical. Would you use that?"

**SIGNAL CHECK (1.5 min)**
- "Real interest level - 1-10?" [Anything 6+ is positive signal]
- "Would you pay for this?" [Yes/No/Maybe]
- "Anyone else doing similar research I should talk to?" [Get referral]

**CLOSE (30 sec)**
"Really appreciate it."

## SCRIPT 3: Chaos Engine (5 min call)

**OPENING (30 sec)**
"Thanks for time. Testing a tool for novel idea discovery. Quick feedback?"

**DISCOVERY (2 min)**
"How do you currently discover new research directions? What's hard about it?" [Listen for: stuck in domain, need fresh perspectives, combinatorial thinking]

**PITCH (1 min)**
"What if a tool randomly combined your domain with unrelated fields? Physics × poetry. Game theory × mycology. Most nonsense, 1% genius. Would you play with this for idea generation?"

**SIGNAL CHECK (1.5 min)**
- "Would you find this useful?" [Yes/No/Maybe]
- "How much would you pay?" [Free vs paid interest]
- "Who's doing similar innovation work?" [Get referral]

**CLOSE (30 sec)**
"Thanks for input."

## SCORE IMMEDIATELY AFTER

For each call, immediately score (1 min):

**Signal A: Problem Recognition**
- They mentioned the pain naturally? YES(+2) / NO(0)

**Signal B: Solution Interest**
- They showed real interest in using this? YES(+2) / MAYBE(+1) / NO(0)

**Signal C: Willingness to Pay**
- They'd pay $50+? YES(+2) / MAYBE $20-50(+1) / FREE ONLY(-1)

**Total per call:** 0-6 points

**Track:** Put score in sheet immediately while memory fresh.

## TIPS FOR SUCCESS

1. **Shut up and listen.** Ask question, then be silent. Don't interrupt.
2. **Go off-script if interesting.** If they mention pain, dig into it.
3. **Watch for energy.** Real interest vs being polite.
4. **Get referrals.** Every call should end with "who else?"
5. **Record their exact words.** Use verbatim quotes in your notes.
6. **No selling.** You're listening, not convincing. If they're not interested, that's data.

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

After 5 calls per idea (15 total):
- At least 3-5 people saying "yes, I'd use this"
- Clear articulation of the problem they face
- At least 2 people willing to pay ($20+ per month)
- Multiple referrals to similar people

That = strong signal = GO DEEP on that idea.

---

## WHAT REJECTION LOOKS LIKE

People say:
- "Interesting idea but I wouldn't use it"
- "I'm happy with current peer review"
- "Too niche for me"
- "I'd only use it if free"

That = weak signal = PIVOT to different angle or try different customer segment.

## QUICK REFERENCE

| Idea | Opening | Key Pain to Listen For | Pitch | Signal Words |
|------|---------|---|---|---|
| Prison | "Brutal hypothesis validation" | "Peer review is slow/soft/not rigorous" | "AI interrogator, instant" | "Would use", "Would pay" |
| Nightmare | "Aggressive peer review" | "Peer review lacks depth/honesty" | "Brutal, instant feedback" | "Yes", "$50+", "useful" |
| Chaos | "Novel idea discovery" | "Stuck in domain/need fresh ideas" | "Random domain collisions" | "Would play", "Useful", "Pay" |

Keep it simple. Time it strictly. Score immediately. Move to next.
