**20+ points (avg 4+):** STRONG SIGNAL → GO DEEP
- Means: People love this, would pay, real problem
- Next: 4-week deep validation, then build

**10-19 points (avg 2-3):** MIXED SIGNAL → INTERESTING
- Means: Some interest, maybe need to pivot angle
- Next: Test different angle or different customer segment

**<10 points (avg <2):** WEAK SIGNAL → SKIP
- Means: Not resonating in this form
- Next: Learn lesson, try different idea
