# RESEARCH PRISON - INVESTOR PITCH DECK
## AI That Interrogates Hypotheses Until They Confess or Prove Innocent

---

## SLIDE 1: HOOK/PROBLEM

**Hook:** "6 months into your PhD research, you discover your core hypothesis is fatally flawed."

**Problem Statement:**
- 68% of research projects fail due to flawed initial hypotheses (Nature Survey 2023)
- Average PhD student wastes 14 months on doomed research paths
- $42 billion annually wasted globally on research with preventable flaws
- Current peer review happens AFTER the damage is done

**Why It Matters:**
- Research velocity determines competitive advantage in biotech, pharma, and tech
- Failed research = lost careers, funding, and breakthrough delays
- The cost of being wrong compounds exponentially over time

---

## SLIDE 2: MARKET SIZE

**TAM (Total Addressable Market): $8.2 Billion**
- 8.2 million researchers worldwide
- Average research budget: $250K/year
- Willingness to pay for validation: 4% of budget = $10K/year

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market): $1.6 Billion**
- 2 million researchers in US/EU/UK
- English-speaking, digitally-enabled markets
- Early adopters in tech, biotech, pharma sectors

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): $120 Million**
- 100,000 PhD students and postdocs (Year 1-3)
- 50,000 R&D professionals at tech companies
- Average revenue per user: $800/year

---

## SLIDE 3: SOLUTION

**What We're Building:**
An AI interrogation system that stress-tests research hypotheses through 2,000+ targeted questions across 10 critical dimensions until they either break or prove robust.

**Why It's Novel:**
- First adversarial approach to hypothesis validation
- Real-time interrogation with dynamic question generation
- Gamified "survival" experience that researchers actually want to use

**Why Now:**
- GPT-4 finally enables sophisticated scientific reasoning
- Research reproducibility crisis at all-time high (70% papers can't be replicated)
- Remote research trend requires digital validation tools

---

## SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS

**3-Step User Journey:**

1. **Submit Hypothesis** (2 minutes)
   - Upload research proposal or paper draft
   - Select interrogation intensity (Standard/Maximum/Nightmare)
   - Add supporting evidence and context

2. **Survive Interrogation** (2 hours)
   - Watch real-time "hypothesis health" meter
   - AI attacks from 10 dimensions: logical, statistical, methodological, etc.
   - Respond to critical challenges in real-time

3. **Get Confession Report** (Instant)
   - Detailed weakness analysis with severity scores
   - Defense strategies for each vulnerability
   - Recommended experiments to strengthen hypothesis

**Key Differentiator:**
Live, adversarial interrogation vs. passive review tools—like having 20 hostile reviewers attack your work BEFORE you invest months.

---

## SLIDE 5: TRACTION & VALIDATION

**Early Customer Interest:**
- 127 researchers on waitlist from Twitter launch
