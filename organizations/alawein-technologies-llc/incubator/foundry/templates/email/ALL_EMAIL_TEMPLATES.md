```
Tweet 1:
I'm building in public. Week 1 goal: talk to 10 [TARGET USERS] about [PROBLEM].

No code written yet. Just validation.

Here's what I'm learning 🧵

Tweet 2:
Sent 35 cold emails.
Got 12 responses (34% response rate).
Scheduled 8 interviews.

Key learning: Mentioning [SPECIFIC DETAIL] in the subject line doubled open rates.

Tweet 3:
Interview #1: [NAME/ROLE] mentioned [PAIN POINT].
Pain severity: 8/10.
Currently using [TOOL] but it doesn't solve [SPECIFIC GAP].

This might be something...

Tweet 4:
After 5 interviews, pattern emerging:
- 4/5 mentioned [SAME PAIN]
- Average severity: 7.6/10
- All paying $X/mo for partial solutions

Hypothesis validated? Maybe.

10 more interviews to go.

Tweet 5:
Lessons from Week 1:
1. People WILL talk to you if you ask
2. Pain is more specific than I thought
3. Current solutions suck in [SPECIFIC WAY]

Week 2: Show mockups, test solutions.
