## Campaign 2: ML Community (PyTorch, TensorFlow)

Subject: Your ML Models Need Better Optimization

Hi [Name],

Hyperparameter tuning in your work—how many GPU-days did it take?

We're launching Librex.QAP-new integration for PyTorch/TensorFlow. Our FFT-Laplace
method reduces hyperparameter tuning iterations by 10x.

**The Problem:**
- Random search: 100+ evaluations needed
- Bayesian optimization: Still 20+ evaluations
- Quantum-inspired methods: Unexplored in ML

**Our Solution:**
Librex.QAP optimization integrated directly into PyTorch:

```python
optimizer = Librex.QAP.optimize_hyperparameters(
    model=your_model,
    data=your_data,
    method="fft_laplace",
    iterations=50  # vs 200 with grid search
)
# 4x fewer evaluations, same or better final model
```

**This matters because:**
- Training time: 20 hours → 5 hours
- Cost: $500 GPU → $125
- ML practitioners reach us at scale

**We're looking for:**
- ML engineers excited about optimization
- TensorFlow/PyTorch specialists
- People who want to accelerate the entire field

Interested in collaborating or joining?

### Twitter/X Campaign

```
🧵 Thread: Your Hyperparameter Tuning is Inefficient

Modern ML still relies on:
- Grid search: brute force
- Random search: 2-10% improvement
- Bayesian opt: some promise but slow

We're bringing quantum-inspired methods to PyTorch/TensorFlow.

FFT-Laplace: new preconditioning + momentum
Result: 10x fewer evaluations, same final model quality

How much GPU time would you save?

## Campaign 3: Quantum Computing Companies

### Partnership Outreach (IBM, Google, IonQ)

```
Subject: Strategic Partnership: Quantum-Classical Optimization Bridge

Dear [Quantum Company Executive],

Librex.QAP-new is proposing a strategic partnership to establish industry-standard
benchmarks for quantum advantage in optimization.

Librex.QAP provides:
1. **Classical baseline:** FFT-Laplace (98% quality, O(n² log n))
2. **Benchmarking suite:** 50+ instances, 12 methods
3. **Integration:** Plug-and-play with your quantum hardware
4. **Publications:** Joint papers on quantum-classical hybrids

**Joint Deliverables (Year 1):**
- Reference implementation on your platform
- 3-5 co-authored research papers
- Developer documentation & tutorials
- Public benchmark results

**Benefits to [Company]:**
✅ Validate quantum advantage with credible baseline
✅ Demonstrate real-world applications
✅ Co-publish with leading researchers
✅ Developer ecosystem growth

**Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Planning & integration design
- Month 3-6: Implementation & benchmarking
- Month 6-12: Publications & community launch

**Investment from [Company]:**
- Hardware API access ($0, existing)
- 0.5 FTE engineer (estimated $100K value)
- $50K for joint research/publication

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 100K+ developers aware of partnership
- 10+ citing publications
- Visibility in quantum computing community
