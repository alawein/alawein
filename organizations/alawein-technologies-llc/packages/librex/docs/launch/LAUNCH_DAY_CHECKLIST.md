## CRISIS MANAGEMENT

### If Code Breaks
1. Run tests: `python test_integration.py`
2. If fails, debug immediately
3. Post status update: "Minor API issue being fixed"
4. Fix and redeploy
5. Update: "Fixed! Ready to go"

### If Bad Feedback
1. Read carefully - is it valid?
2. If valid: "Thanks for feedback, we'll look into it"
3. If invalid: "We designed it this way because..."
4. Never get defensive - stay professional

### If No Response
1. Day 1: Normal, give it time
2. Day 2-3: Adjust messaging, try different angle
3. Day 4+: Reassess strategy, ask for feedback

### If Too Many Applications
1. Great problem to have!
2. Prioritize quality candidates
3. May need to move to assessments faster
4. Expand recruiting team if needed

### If Partnership Interested but Slow
1. Normal - corporate processes take time
2. Schedule follow-up call
3. Send additional info if requested
4. Don't push too hard
5. Let them come to you
