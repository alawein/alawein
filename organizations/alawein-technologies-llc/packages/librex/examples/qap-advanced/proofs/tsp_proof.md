## Problem Statement

Problem of type: TSPProblem

---

## Reasoning Trace

Below is the complete reasoning process, step by step.

### Step 1: none_applicable

**Status**: ✗ Failed

**Reasoning**: No applicable primitives found for current state

**Confidence**: 50.0%

**State Before**:
```
{'initial_state_value': <__main__.TSPState object at 0x7ea027754090>, 'objective': <function main.<locals>.objective at 0x7ea0275285e0>}
```

**State After**:
```
{'initial_state_value': <__main__.TSPState object at 0x7ea027754090>, 'objective': <function main.<locals>.objective at 0x7ea0275285e0>}
```

## Confidence Analysis

**Overall Confidence**: 50.0%

---

## Validation

The solution was validated using:

- ✓ Solution Exists: Solution generated
- ✗ Goal Reached: Incomplete
- ✗ High Confidence: Confidence: 50.0%

---

## Known Limitations

- ⚠️ Low confidence (50.0%) - solution may be unreliable
- ⚠️ Solution did not reach stated goal
- ⚠️ Very few iterations - problem may be trivial or ill-defined
