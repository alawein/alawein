## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE

**This FAQ previously promoted building without validation. That was wrong.**

**NEW APPROACH:**
- ✅ Validate ONE product first (4 weeks)
- ✅ Get 10+ pre-sales before building
- ✅ Build ONLY if validated
- ✅ Focus on $100K ARR, not $1M ARR

**For full FAQ, see:** [FAQ.md (updated version)](FAQ.md) ← **Validation-first Q&A**

**A:** Read these in order (45 min total):
1. [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md) - Master navigation
2. [VALIDATION_FIRST.md](.meta/guides/VALIDATION_FIRST.md) - Why validation
3. [WEEK_1_CHECKLIST.md](.meta/guides/WEEK_1_CHECKLIST.md) - Daily actions

Then send 10 interview request emails TODAY.

---

### Q: How much does this cost?

**A:** Start with $0-500 for validation (Week 1-4).

Only invest $50K+ if you get 10+ pre-sales proving demand.

**Don't spend money building unvalidated ideas.**

---

### Q: Do I need to know how to code?

**A:** Not for validation (Week 1-4).

For building (IF validated): YES, or find technical co-founder, or hire developer.

**Do validation first. Solve technical problem later.**

---

### Q: Which product should I build?

**A:** Whichever ONE you validate first.

Don't assume. Interview 20 people. Get 10+ pre-sales. Then build.

**Read:** [PRIORITY_RANKING.md](.meta/analysis/PRIORITY_RANKING.md) for our suggestion (but validate yourself).

---

### Q: What if I can't get 10 pre-sales?

**A:** DON'T BUILD. You just saved 6 months and $50K.

**Options:**
- Pivot one variable (different target, problem, or solution)
- Try different idea from repository
- This is SUCCESS (you learned fast and cheap)

**Read:** [QUICK_DECISIONS.md](QUICK_DECISIONS.md) Section 3

---

### Q: Do I need to quit my job?

**A:** NO. Not until $5K+ MRR.

Validation: 10 hrs/week nights/weekends
Building: 20 hrs/week nights/weekends

Quit only when: $5K+ MRR + 3 months runway + 15%+ growth

---

### Q: How long does this take?

**A:** Realistic timeline:
- Weeks 1-4: Validation
- Weeks 5-28: Build (IF validated)
- Months 7-12: Grow to $10K MRR
- Months 13-18: Scale to $50K MRR

**Total: 18 months to $50K MRR** (not 52 weeks to $1M ARR as originally stated)

---

### Q: I'm overwhelmed. What do I do?

**A:** Do ONE thing right now:

1. Open [ALL_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md](.meta/templates/email-templates/ALL_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md)
2. Copy template #1 (Interview Request)
3. Find ONE person on Google Scholar
4. Personalize email (2 min)
5. Send it (10 seconds)

**Done. You've started.** ✅

Tomorrow: Send 9 more.

---

### Q: What if validation fails?

**A:** Congratulations! You saved 6 months and $50K.

"Validation failure" = cheap learning = SUCCESS

Pick new idea. Validate again. Repeat until one works.

**Expected: 2-3 validation attempts before success**

---

### Q: Where can I get help?

**A:** Try in order:
1. [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](.meta/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) - 12 common blockers
2. [QUICK_DECISIONS.md](QUICK_DECISIONS.md) Section 6 - Reset guide
3. IndieHackers forum - Post specific question

7. Ghost Researchers - Historical scientists review your work
8. Failure Futures Market - Prediction market for hypotheses
9. Research Battle Royale - 100 hypotheses, 1 survives
10. Multiverse Tester - Test across alternate realities

---

### Q: Do I have to build all 10? (OUTDATED)

**A (OLD):** NO! Start with 3 (Phase 1): Nightmare Mode, Chaos Engine, and Research Prison.

**A (NEW):** Validate ONE first. Build that ONE. Scale to $100K MRR. Then consider #2.

**OLD Timeline (Wrong):**
- Phase 1 (Months 1-4): Ship 3 products → $15K MRR
- Phase 2 (Months 5-9): Add 2 more → $50K MRR
- Phase 3+ (Months 10-24): Add remaining 5 → $100K-500K MRR

**NEW Timeline (Realistic):**
- Months 1-6: Validate + Build Product #1 → $1-5K MRR
- Months 7-12: Grow Product #1 → $10-20K MRR
- Months 13-18: Scale Product #1 → $50-100K MRR
- Decision: Scale #1 to $500K+ OR validate Product #2

---

### Q: How much will this cost to build? (OUTDATED)

**A (OLD):**
- **Phase 1 (3 products):** $95K development + $20K operations = **$115K total**
- **Full platform (10 products):** $720K over 24 months

**A (NEW):**
- **Validation:** $0-500 (4 weeks)
- **IF validated (10+ pre-sales):** $50K for MVP (24 weeks)
- **Scaling:** Variable based on traction

**Start with $500. Only invest more if demand is proven.**

---

### Q: How long will it take? (OUTDATED)

**A:**
- **Phase 1:** 16 weeks (4 months) if you have 2-3 developers
- **Phase 1 (solo):** 30 weeks if you're working alone
- **Full platform:** 24 months to all 10 products

**Reality check:** Most people quit after 2 weeks. If you ship Phase 1, you're in the top 1%.

---

## 💰 Business Model

### Q: How do I make money?

**A:** Subscription model (SaaS):
- **Free tier:** Limited use (3 attacks/month, 10 collisions/month)
- **Basic ($9/mo):** For individual researchers
- **Pro ($29/mo):** For power users
- **Teams ($99/mo):** For research labs (5 seats)
- **Enterprise (custom):** For universities/corporations

**Expected revenue:**
- Month 4: $5K MRR
- Month 12: $130K MRR
- Month 24: $948K MRR

---

### Q: What if people don't pay?

**A:** Then you pivot or shut down. That's why Phase 1 is only $115K (not $720K).

**Risk mitigation:**
- Beta test with real users first (Week 6-8)
- Get 10 paying customers before public launch (Week 11)
- If conversion rate <3% by Week 12, investigate immediately
- If MRR isn't growing by Week 16, reevaluate

**Safety net:** Phase 1 validates the entire concept. If it doesn't work, you haven't wasted 2 years and $720K.

---

### Q: Is this actually profitable?

**A:** Yes, IF you execute. The math:

**Unit Economics:**
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $20
- LTV (Lifetime Value): $345
- LTV:CAC Ratio: 17:1 ✅

**Profitability:**
- Break-even: Month 6 (revenue covers costs)
- Fully profitable: Month 14 (all investment recovered)
- ROI at Month 24: 875%

**Comparison:** Typical SaaS aims for 3:1 LTV:CAC. We're targeting 17:1. That's excellent unit economics.

---

## 🔧 Technical Questions

### Q: What if I'm not a developer?

**A:** You have 3 options:

**Option 1:** Learn to code (3-6 months)
- Start with Python + FastAPI (backend)
- Learn React + Next.js (frontend)
- Total learning time: ~200 hours
- Resources: FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, FastAPI tutorial

**Option 2:** Find a technical co-founder
- Go to hackathons, meetups, online communities
- Pitch your vision
- Offer 30-50% equity + co-founder title

**Option 3:** Hire developers
- Budget: $50-150/hour depending on location
- Use Upwork, Toptal, or local devs
- Start with one full-stack developer ($10K/month)

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (co-founder) is best for non-technical founders.

---

### Q: Can I use no-code tools instead?

**A:** For validation, YES. For production, NO.

**Why:**
- These products require AI integration (GPT-4, Claude)
- Complex backend logic (multi-agent systems, debate phases)
- Real-time features (WebSockets for live attacks)
- Performance requirements (handle 1000s of users)

**No-code limitations:** You'll hit a wall quickly.

**Strategy:** Build no-code MVP to validate idea → Rebuild in code for production.

---

### Q: What tech stack should I use?

**A:** Use what's in the templates:

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python) - Fast, easy to learn, great for AI integration
- PostgreSQL - Reliable SQL database
- Redis - Caching and sessions

**Frontend:**
- Next.js (React + TypeScript) - Best for SEO, fast, popular
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS, fast styling

**AI:**
- OpenAI (GPT-4) - Best overall model
- Anthropic (Claude) - Great for multi-model ensemble

**Infrastructure:**
- Vercel (frontend hosting) - Free tier, easy deploy
- Railway/Render (backend hosting) - $5-20/month
- Supabase (database) - Free tier

**Total cost:** ~$100/month for MVP, scales as you grow.

---

### Q: Can I use a different tech stack?

**A:** Yes, but you'll have to adapt the templates yourself.

**Popular alternatives:**
- Backend: Node.js/Express, Django, Ruby on Rails
- Frontend: Vue, Svelte, Angular
- Database: MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase

**Trade-off:** Starting from scratch vs. using battle-tested templates.

---

## 👥 Team & Resources

### Q: Can I do this solo?

**A:** Yes, but it's harder.

**Solo path:**
- Timeline: 30 weeks (vs 16 weeks with team)
- Strategy: Build products sequentially (Prison → Chaos → Nightmare)
- Challenge: No one to brainstorm with, more prone to burnout
- Benefit: Keep 100% equity, move at your own pace

**Success rate:** ~20% (vs ~60% with co-founder)

**Recommendation:** Find at least 1 co-founder (technical + non-technical pair is ideal).

---

### Q: How do I find a co-founder?

**A:** 5 strategies:

1. **Friends/Colleagues:** Anyone you've worked with who's excellent?
2. **Hackathons:** Go to local hackathons, meet builders
3. **Online:** Y Combinator Co-Founder Matching, CoFoundersLab
4. **Communities:** Indie Hackers, Reddit r/cofounder
5. **Universities:** Reach out to grad students in CS departments

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "Idea person" who won't code/work
- ❌ Not willing to quit day job (not committed)
- ❌ Wants 50% equity but contributes 20%

**Green flags:**
- ✅ Has built and shipped things before
- ✅ Willing to work nights/weekends for 4 months
- ✅ Excited about the problem, not just money

---

### Q: How much should I pay developers?

**A:** Depends on how you hire:

**Freelancers (Upwork):**
- Junior: $30-50/hour
- Mid-level: $50-100/hour
- Senior: $100-150/hour

**Full-time employees:**
- Junior: $60-80K/year
- Mid-level: $80-120K/year
- Senior: $120-180K/year

**Equity vs Cash:**
- Early employees: Offer 0.5-2% equity + lower salary
- Contractors: Cash only (no equity)

**Phase 1 budget:** $95K assumes mid-level freelancers at $75/hour.

---

### Q: Should I raise money or bootstrap?

**A:** Bootstrap first, raise later (if needed).

**Why bootstrap Phase 1:**
- Prove concept with real revenue
- Keep 100% equity
- Learn how to build a sustainable business
- Raise from position of strength (better terms)

**When to raise:**
- After hitting $10K+ MRR (Seed round: $500K-2M)
- After hitting $100K+ MRR (Series A: $5-15M)

**Reality:** Most founders raise too early (before product-market fit). Don't make that mistake.

---

## 📈 Market & Competition

### Q: Is there already a market for this?

**A:** YES. Research tools is a $X billion market.

**Existing players:**
- Grammarly (writing assistant) - $13B valuation

**A:** There's always competition. That's a good sign (validates market).

**Direct competitors:**
- AI peer review tools (emerging)
- Research validation platforms (niche)

**Indirect competitors:**
- ChatGPT (researchers use for critiques)
- Human peer reviewers (slow, expensive)

**Your advantage:**
- Specialized tools (not generic AI)
- Multi-product platform (network effects)
- First-mover in many categories (Chaos Engine, Research Prison)

**Strategy:** Build better products, ship faster, market smarter.

---

### Q: What if someone steals my idea?

**A:** Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything.

**Reality:**
- This entire repository is public (anyone can copy)
- Yet 99% won't execute
- 1% will try and quit after 2 weeks
- 0.1% will actually ship

**Your moat:**
- Speed (ship before copycats)
- Execution quality (better product)
- Brand (first wins mindshare)
- Network effects (users bring more users)

**Advice:** Stop worrying about idea theft. Start worrying about execution.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Q: Where do I start?

**A:** Follow the 3-command quick start:

```bash
# 1. Create repository
cd .meta/scripts
./create-repo.sh nightmare-mode ORCHEX-nightmare-validator

# 2. Add API keys
cd ../../ORCHEX-nightmare-validator
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env, add OpenAI key

# 3. Start coding
docker-compose up
```

**Then:** Follow Week 1 plan in `.meta/roadmaps/PHASE_1_QUICK_WINS.md`

---

### Q: What if I don't have $115K?

**A:** You have options:

**Option 1: Start smaller**
- Build just 1 product (Research Prison: $25K, 8 weeks)
- Validate market
- Use revenue to fund next product

**Option 2: Freelance while building**
- Work part-time ($2-3K/month income)
- Build nights/weekends (slower, but sustainable)
- Total time: 6-9 months instead of 4 months

**Option 3: Find paying customers first**
- Presell annual subscriptions ($290/year)
- Need 40 customers × $290 = $11.6K upfront
- Use that to fund initial development

**Option 4: Friends & Family round**
- Raise $25-50K from people who believe in you
- Offer 10-20% equity or convertible note
- Ship Phase 1, raise more if needed

**Reality:** Most successful startups started with <$50K. Money helps, but execution matters more.

---

### Q: What if I get stuck?

**A:** Use the emergency procedures:

**Stuck on code:**
1. Google it (30 min limit)
2. Ask GPT-4/Claude (15 min limit)
3. Stack Overflow (1 hour limit)
4. Pay someone on Fiverr $50 to fix it

**Never waste >1 day stuck on a technical problem.**

**Losing motivation:**
1. Read your Step 1 commitment
2. Talk to a user (their excitement refuels you)
3. Review progress (look how far you've come!)
4. Take a guilt-free day off

**Running out of money:**
1. Freelance gig (immediate cash)
2. Presell subscriptions (validate + fund)
3. Friends & family (small raise)
4. Part-time job (sustainable but slower)

---

### Q: What if I fail?

**A:** Then you learn more than any course could teach you.

**What you gain even if you "fail":**
- Real product development experience
- Understanding of startups/business
- Portfolio project (helps get jobs)
- Network of fellow builders
- Confidence that you can build things

**Success rate reality:**
- 90% quit before Week 4 (you're not them)
- 9% ship something but fail to get traction
- 1% build successful businesses

**Key insight:** Even "failures" are valuable. Most successful founders failed 2-3 times first.

---

## 📊 Metrics & Success

### Q: How do I know if it's working?

**A:** Track these 5 metrics (weekly):

1. **MRR:** Growing >20%/month?
2. **Users:** Growing >50%/month?
3. **Conversion:** >7% free-to-paid?
4. **Churn:** <5%/month?
5. **NPS:** >40?

**If all 5 are green → It's working!**
**If 3+ are red → Investigate immediately**

---

### Q: What's a realistic outcome?

**A:** Here are the scenarios:

**Best case (20%):**
- $100K+ MRR by Month 12
- Profitable, growing business
- Option to raise Series A or continue bootstrapping
- Life-changing outcome

**Base case (30%):**
- $15-50K MRR by Month 12
- Sustainable side income or full-time income
- Continue growing or sell
- Great outcome

**Modest case (30%):**
- $1-15K MRR by Month 12
- Not enough to quit day job yet
- Pivot or persevere decision
- Learning experience + portfolio

**Failure case (20%):**
- <$1K MRR by Month 12
- Shut down or major pivot
- Valuable lessons learned
- Still better than not trying

---

## 🎯 Strategy & Direction

### Q: What if I want to change the products?

**A:** DO IT! This is YOUR business.

**The 10 ideas are suggestions, not commandments.**

**How to validate your own idea:**
1. Talk to 10 potential users
2. Ask: "Would you pay $X/month for this?"
3. If 7+ say yes → Build it
4. If <5 say yes → Rethink it

**Rule:** Build what users will pay for, not what you think is cool.

---

### Q: Can I just build 1 product really well?

**A:** Absolutely! That's often the best strategy.

**Examples:**
- Grammarly: Just writing assistance → $13B valuation
- Calendly: Just scheduling → $3B valuation
- Notion: Just notes/docs → $10B valuation

**Strategy:** Master one thing vs. being mediocre at 10 things.

**When to expand:** After hitting $100K MRR on Product 1, consider Product 2.

---

### Q: What about international markets?

**A:** Phase 1: Focus on English-speaking markets (US, UK, Canada, Australia).

**Why:** Easier marketing, customer support, legal compliance.

**When to expand:**
- After $50K MRR
- Hire translators
- Localize pricing (lower in developing countries)
- Test one country at a time

**Biggest markets:** China, India, Brazil, Europe.

---

## 💡 Misc Questions

### Q: Do I need a company/LLC?

**A:** Eventually, yes. But not on Day 1.

**Timeline:**
- Day 1-30: Just start building (no entity needed)
- Day 30-90: Set up LLC when you start accepting payments
- Month 6+: Consider C-corp if raising venture capital

**Why:** Legal protection (separate business/personal assets) and tax benefits.

**Cost:** $100-500 to set up LLC (varies by state).

---

### Q: What about legal/privacy/GDPR?

**A:** Use standard templates:

**Required:**
- Terms of Service (use Termly, free template)
- Privacy Policy (use Termly, free template)
- Cookie Policy (if EU users)

**GDPR compliance:**
- Don't collect unnecessary data
- Allow users to delete their data
- Get consent for cookies
- Have a privacy policy

**Cost:** Free (templates) or $500-2K (lawyer review)

**When:** Before public launch (Week 11)

---

### Q: How do I handle customer support?

**A:** Phase 1: You handle it manually.

**Tools:**
- Email (start with plain Gmail)
- Intercom (add live chat when >50 users)
- Help docs (Notion or plain markdown)

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Reply to every email yourself
- Months 4-6: Create FAQ/help docs (answer common questions)
- Months 7+: Hire part-time support (when >100 support emails/week)

**Pro tip:** Support emails are GOLD. Users tell you exactly what to fix.

---

### Q: What if I want to sell the business later?

**A:** Build with that in mind from Day 1.

**Makes business more sellable:**
- ✅ Clean code (documented, tested)
- ✅ Recurring revenue (SaaS model)
- ✅ Low churn (<5%/month)
- ✅ Automated processes (not dependent on you)
- ✅ Financial records (clean books)

**Typical valuation:** 3-10x ARR

**Examples:**
- $100K ARR → $300K-1M sale price
- $1M ARR → $3-10M sale price
- $10M ARR → $30-100M sale price

**When to sell:** When you get a life-changing offer OR when you're burned out.

---

### Q: What's the success rate?

**A:** Honest answer:

**Of 100 people who read this:**
- 90 will bookmark and never start
- 7 will start and quit by Week 4
- 2 will ship something but fail to get traction
- 1 will build a successful business

**Your goal:** Be the 1.

**How:** Execute the plan. Don't give up at first obstacle. Talk to users weekly.

---
