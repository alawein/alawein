## Section 1: Start Validation

**Your situation:** Idea in head, nothing validated

### ✅ DO THIS (Next 60 minutes):
1. Read `.meta/guides/VALIDATION_FIRST.md` (15 min)
2. Make list of 50 potential users to interview (30 min)
3. Send 10 emails asking for 15-min interviews (15 min)

### 📋 Template Email (Copy/Paste):
```
Subject: Quick question about [THEIR RESEARCH AREA]

Hi [Name],

I'm researching how [TARGET USER TYPE] currently [DO TASK/HANDLE PROBLEM].

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call this week? I'm trying to understand
the workflow and pain points.

Not selling anything - genuinely trying to learn.

[Your Name]
```

### ❌ DO NOT:
- ❌ Start building anything
- ❌ Create mockups yet
- ❌ Build a landing page
- ❌ Spend money on ads
- ❌ Read 10 more guides (you're procrastinating)

### ⏱️ Timeline:
- **This week:** Schedule 5 interviews
- **Next week:** Conduct 10 interviews
- **Week 3:** Show mockups, launch pre-sale
- **Week 4:** Decision (GO/PIVOT/STOP)

### 📊 Success Metric:
- Schedule 10 interviews by end of Week 1
- If you can't recruit 10 people → market may not be accessible → PIVOT

**→ NEXT:** After Week 1, return to this guide and go to Section 3 or 2 based on results

---

## Section 2: Start Building

**Your situation:** 10+ people pre-paid $99 before you built anything

**🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! You've validated demand. Now build fast.**

### ✅ DO THIS (Today):
1. Email all pre-sale customers:
```
Subject: We're building [Product Name]! Here's the timeline

Hi [Name],

Thank you for pre-ordering! We hit our goal of 10 early customers, so we're
officially building this.

Timeline:
- Weeks 1-4: Core features
- Week 5-6: Private beta (you get access here!)
- Week 7: Polish based on your feedback
- Week 8: Full launch

You'll get access by [DATE - 6 weeks from now].

Weekly updates every Friday. Got feedback already? Reply anytime.

Thanks for believing in this before it existed!

[Your Name]
```

2. Set up development environment:
```bash
cd .meta/scripts
./create-repo.sh nightmare-mode ORCHEX-nightmare-validator
cd ../../ORCHEX-nightmare-validator
docker-compose up
```

3. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (30 min)
4. Start Week 1 build plan from `.meta/roadmaps/PHASE_1_QUICK_WINS.md`

### ❌ DO NOT:
- ❌ Build every feature you thought of
- ❌ Aim for perfection
- ❌ Stop talking to users
- ❌ Add features not requested by pre-sale customers
- ❌ Take longer than 8 weeks

### ⏱️ Timeline:
- **Week 1-4:** Build core 3 features (ones most requested in interviews)
- **Week 5:** Give access to first 5 customers
- **Week 6:** Iterate based on feedback
- **Week 7:** Give access to all 10 customers
- **Week 8:** Public launch

### 📊 Success Metrics:
- Week 5: 5 customers using it daily
- Week 8: 10 customers using it, 8+/10 satisfied
- Week 12: $1K+ MRR from new customers beyond pre-sales

**→ NEXT:** After Week 8, go to Section 4 (Iterating)

---

## Section 3: Weak Validation

**Your situation:** Completed validation, got 1-9 pre-sales (not 10+)

### 🟡 YOU'RE IN THE DANGER ZONE

**Options:**

### Option A: Try Harder (If you got 5-9 pre-sales)
**DO THIS:**
1. Email 20 MORE prospects with pre-sale offer
2. Lower price to $49 (test if price was issue)
3. Post in 5 more communities (Reddit, forums, Twitter)
4. Run $100 ad campaign (Facebook/Google)
5. Set deadline: 2 weeks to get to 10 total pre-sales

**IF you hit 10 total → Go to Section 2**
**IF you don't → Go to Option B**

---

### Option B: Pivot ONE Variable (If you got 1-4 pre-sales)
**Something is wrong. Change ONE thing:**

**Pivot Matrix:**

| What to Change | New Approach | Timeline |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Target Market** | Different user segment (industry vs. academia, senior vs. junior researchers) | 2 weeks to re-validate |
| **Problem** | Focus on subset of pain (e.g., ONLY statistical validation, not full critique) | 2 weeks to re-validate |
| **Solution** | Different approach to same problem (service instead of software, etc.) | 2 weeks to re-validate |
| **Price** | Much cheaper ($10/mo) OR much more expensive ($199/mo for premium segment) | 1 week to re-test |

**DO THIS:**
1. Analyze interviews: Why didn't they buy?
   - No urgency? → Wrong problem or market
   - Too expensive? → Wrong price or insufficient value
   - Missing features? → Wrong solution
   - "I'll wait for reviews"? → Wrong early adopter segment

2. Pick ONE thing to change
3. Re-run validation (2 weeks)
4. Get to 10 pre-sales OR → Option C

---

### Option C: STOP (If you got 0 pre-sales OR failed 2 pivots)
**Harsh truth: This idea doesn't have demand (yet).**

**DO THIS:**
1. Thank all interviewees
2. Refund any payments
3. Document lessons learned:
```
LESSONS FROM [IDEA NAME]

What I thought:
- [Assumption 1]
- [Assumption 2]

What I learned:
- [Reality 1]
- [Reality 2]

What I'd do differently:
- [Learning 1]
- [Learning 2]

Next idea to try: [Pick from the 10 in this repo]
```

4. Pick different idea from this repository
5. Start validation again (Section 1)

**REMEMBER:** You just saved 6 months and $50K. This is a WIN, not a failure.

**→ NEXT:** Go back to Section 1 with new idea

---

## Section 4: Iterating

**Your situation:** Have MVP, 10-50 users, getting feedback

### ✅ DO THIS (Every Week):
1. **Monday:** Review last week's metrics
   - Active users
   - Feature usage
   - Support tickets
   - Churn

2. **Tuesday-Thursday:** Interview 3 users
   - What's working?
   - What's frustrating?
   - What's missing?
   - Would you recommend to colleague?

3. **Friday:** Ship 1 improvement based on feedback

4. **Weekly email to all users:**
```
Subject: This Week's Update - [Product Name]

Hi everyone,

This week we:
- Fixed: [Bug/issue from user feedback]
- Added: [Small feature requested by 3+ users]
- Improved: [Performance/UX improvement]

Coming next week:
- [Next priority based on feedback]

Keep the feedback coming!

[Your Name]

P.S. - Using [Product]? Reply with what you love / what drives you crazy.
```

### ❌ DO NOT:
- ❌ Build features only 1 person requested
- ❌ Stop shipping for more than 1 week
- ❌ Ignore user feedback
- ❌ Add features without validating demand
- ❌ Optimize prematurely (perfect code doesn't matter if product is wrong)

### 📊 Success Metrics (Month 2-6):
- **User Retention:** >50% active week-over-week
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score):** >30
- **Organic Growth:** 10%+ from referrals
- **MRR Growth:** 15-20% month-over-month

### 🚨 Red Flags:
- ❌ <30% week-over-week retention → Product isn't sticky → Major iteration needed
- ❌ <5% conversion (signup to paid) → Value proposition weak
- ❌ High churn (>10%/month) → Product doesn't solve problem well enough

**IF you see red flags:** Go back to validation (interviews) to understand why

**→ NEXT:** When you hit $5K MRR + strong metrics → Go to Section 5

---

## Section 5: Scaling

**Your situation:** $5-20K MRR, positive unit economics, product working

### ✅ DO THIS:
1. **Audit current state:**
   - LTV:CAC ratio: Should be >3:1 (if not, fix before scaling)
   - Churn: Should be <5%/month
   - NPS: Should be >30

2. **IF metrics are good → Scale acquisition:**
   - Double down on working channels
   - Hire 1 marketing person OR learn marketing
   - Invest in content (SEO, blog, videos)
   - Run paid ads (start with $500/month, scale what works)
   - Build referral program (give users incentive to share)

3. **IF metrics are bad → FIX RETENTION FIRST:**
   - Don't scale a leaky bucket
   - Go back to Section 4 (Iterating)
   - Fix churn before spending on acquisition

### ❌ DO NOT:
- ❌ Scale before unit economics work (you'll just lose money faster)
- ❌ Hire 5 people at once
- ❌ Build 10 new features (focus > features)
- ❌ Pivot to new product until this one hits $50-100K MRR
- ❌ Forget to talk to users (keep doing 3 interviews/week)

### 📊 Success Metrics (Month 7-18):
- **MRR Growth:** 10-15% month-over-month
- **CAC Payback:** <3 months
- **LTV:CAC:** >5:1
- **Gross Margin:** >70%

### 🎯 Milestones:
- **$10K MRR:** You have a real business
- **$25K MRR:** You can pay yourself
- **$50K MRR:** You can hire help
- **$100K MRR:** Decision: Scale this to $1M+ OR start Product #2

**→ NEXT:** When you hit $100K MRR, decide:
- **Option A:** Scale this product to $500K MRR (hire team, raise funding)
- **Option B:** Hire 1 person to run this, start validating Product #2 (repeat cycle)

---

## Section 6: Reset

**Your situation:** Overwhelmed, confused, don't know where to start

### ✅ DO THIS (Right Now):
1. **Close all tabs except this one**

2. **Answer these 3 questions honestly:**

**Question 1: Have you validated demand?**
- ❌ NO → Go to Section 1
- ✅ YES (10+ pre-sales) → Go to Section 2

**Question 2: What's blocking you?**
- "I don't know how to code" → Find technical co-founder OR learn (3 months)
- "I don't have money" → Start with validation ($0-500), save/freelance for build phase
- "I'm afraid of failure" → Reframe: validation failure = cheap learning, not real failure
- "I don't know which idea to pick" → Start with Nightmare Mode (highest score in PRIORITY_RANKING.md)
- "I'm overwhelmed by all these guides" → **STOP READING. Just do Section 1.**

**Question 3: Can you commit 20 hours/week for 4 weeks?**
- ❌ NO → Come back when you can (timing matters)
- ✅ YES → Go to Section 1 NOW

3. **Pick your SINGLE next action:**

```
[ ] Read VALIDATION_FIRST.md (15 min) → Then do Section 1
[ ] Find co-founder (if non-technical) → Use YC Co-Founder Matching
[ ] Save money for build phase → Freelance/side gig while validating
[ ] Clear schedule → Block 20 hrs/week for this
[ ] Get over fear → Remember: 99% never start, you're already ahead
```

### ❌ DO NOT:
- ❌ Read 10 more guides
- ❌ Watch 5 YouTube videos about startups
- ❌ Plan for another week
- ❌ Wait for the "perfect moment"
- ❌ Try to do 3 ideas at once

### 🧘 Mindset Reset:

**If you're scared:**
> "The validation phase costs $0-500. Even if I fail, I learn more than any $10K course could teach. I literally can't lose."

**If you're overwhelmed:**
> "I don't need to know everything. I just need to do the NEXT thing: read VALIDATION_FIRST.md and send 10 emails."

**If you're procrastinating:**
> "Reading more won't help. Only doing will. I'm going to send 1 email in the next 10 minutes."

**→ NEXT:** Take 1 deep breath. Pick Section 1 or 2. Execute today.

## 🎯 Quick Reference: What to Do Based on Your Numbers

| Situation | Immediate Action | Timeline | Next Check-In |
|-----------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| **0 interviews** | Email 10 prospects | Today | 3 days (did 5 respond?) |
| **10 interviews, unclear pain** | Interview 10 MORE | 1 week | Week 2 (is pain consistent?) |
| **Clear pain, no solution** | Create mockups | 2 days | Week 3 (show 10 people) |
| **Mockups ready** | Launch pre-sale | 1 day | 2 weeks (10+ sales?) |
| **1-4 pre-sales** | Pivot one variable | 2 weeks | Month 2 (did pivot work?) |
| **10+ pre-sales** | Start building MVP | 8 weeks | Week 5 (beta feedback?) |
| **MVP done, no users** | Email pre-sale customers | Today | 1 week (are they using it?) |
| **50 users, high churn** | Interview churned users | 1 week | Month 2 (did you fix it?) |
| **$1K MRR, slow growth** | Double down on acquisition | 1 month | Month 2 (20% growth?) |
| **$10K MRR, good metrics** | Scale acquisition | 3 months | Month 4 ($20K MRR?) |

## 🚨 Emergency Decisions

### "Should I quit my job?"
**NO.** Validate nights/weekends. Build nights/weekends. Quit only when you hit $5K MRR with 3 months runway saved.

### "Should I raise funding?"
**NO.** Not until you hit $10K MRR with 15%+ monthly growth. Before that, you're too risky for investors.

### "Should I find a co-founder?"
**MAYBE.** If you're non-technical and can't code → YES, find technical co-founder BEFORE validation. If you can build the MVP solo → NO, stay solo until $10K MRR.

### "Should I pivot?"
**ONLY IF:**
- 0 pre-sales after 30+ interviews → YES
- <5 pre-sales after trying hard → YES
- 10+ pre-sales but bad idea → NO, build it first
- Users churning at >10%/month → Maybe, interview them first

### "Should I stop?"
**YES IF:**
- 0 pre-sales after 2 pivot attempts
- Can't recruit anyone to interview (market doesn't exist)
- You've lost passion for the problem
- Better opportunity came up

**NO IF:**
- You're just scared (fear is normal)
- One person said "no" (you need 10+ signals)
- It's hard (everything worth doing is hard)
