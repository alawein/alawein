## User Acquisition Model

### Growth Assumptions

| Phase | Months | Primary Products | Growth Strategy | Monthly Growth Rate |
|-------|--------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Phase 1 | 1-4 | Nightmare, Chaos, Prison | Product Hunt, HackerNews, Reddit | 150% |
| Phase 2 | 5-9 | + Scientific Tinder, Evolution | Network effects, word-of-mouth | 50% |
| Phase 3 | 10-14 | + Time Travel, Ghost Researchers | Academic partnerships, conferences | 30% |
| Phase 4 | 15-24 | + Futures, Battle Royale, Multiverse | Viral events, media coverage | 25% |

### Conversion Funnel

```
Website Visitors → Free Users → Paying Users
      100%       →     40%     →     7%
```

**Assumptions:**
- 40% of visitors sign up for free account
- 7% of free users convert to paid (industry average: 2-5%, we're targeting premium)
- Average time to conversion: 14 days

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

| Channel | CAC | Conversion Rate | LTV/CAC Ratio |
|---------|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| Organic (Product Hunt, HN) | $5 | 10% | 20:1 |
| Content Marketing (blog, SEO) | $15 | 5% | 8:1 |
| Social Media (Twitter, LinkedIn) | $25 | 3% | 4:1 |
| Paid Ads (Google, Facebook) | $50 | 2% | 2:1 |
| **Blended Average** | **$20** | **5%** | **6:1** |

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Calculation:**
```
Average Monthly Revenue per User (ARPU): $18
Average Lifetime (months): 24
Gross Margin: 80%

LTV = ARPU × Lifetime × Gross Margin
LTV = $18 × 24 × 0.80 = $345
```

**LTV:CAC Ratio = 17:1** (Excellent! Target is >3:1)

- Reinvest profits into Phase 2 development

**Phase 3: Revenue-funded ($121K)**
- Use Phase 2 revenue ($130K MRR by Month 12)
- Continue reinvesting profits

**Phase 4: Revenue-funded or VC ($375K)**
- Option A: Use revenue ($500K+ MRR)
- Option B: Raise Series A ($2-5M) to accelerate

### VC Path (If Aggressive Growth Desired)

**Seed Round: $1-2M**
- Raise after Phase 1 traction
- Use: Hire team (5-10 people), accelerate development
- Valuation: $5-8M (based on growth metrics)

**Series A: $5-10M**
