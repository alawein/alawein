# 🎯 Customer Development Toolkit

**The complete system for understanding your users and validating demand BEFORE you build.**

This toolkit will help you talk to 30 users, validate (or invalidate) your idea, and make evidence-based decisions in 4 weeks.

---

## 🚨 Critical Truth

**95% of startups fail not because they can't build the product, but because they build something nobody wants.**

This toolkit prevents that failure mode.

### Interview #1: Problem Discovery (15-20 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand current workflow and pain points

#### Introduction (2 min)
```
Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. I'm researching how [RESEARCHER TYPE]
currently [DO TASK], and I'd love to learn about your experience.

This isn't a sales call - I'm genuinely trying to understand the problem space.
There are no right or wrong answers, and your honest feedback helps me a ton.

Is it okay if I record this for my notes? (Only if they consent)

Sound good? Great, let's dive in.
```

#### Discovery Questions (12 min)

**Current Workflow:**
1. "Walk me through the last time you [RELEVANT TASK - e.g., 'validated a research hypothesis']."
   - **Listen for:** Steps, tools used, time spent, frustrations

2. "What tools do you currently use for this?"
   - **Listen for:** Existing solutions, workarounds, cobbled-together workflows

3. "How often do you do this?"
   - **Listen for:** Frequency = how urgent the pain is

**Pain Points:**
4. "What's the most frustrating part of that process?"
   - **Listen for:** Specific pain, not generic complaints
   - **Follow-up:** "Can you give me an example of when that happened?"

5. "How much time does this currently take you?"
   - **Listen for:** Quantifiable cost (hours per week)

6. "What have you tried to solve this problem?"
   - **Listen for:** Attempted solutions, whether they've paid for tools

**Prioritization:**
7. "On a scale of 1-10, how big of a problem is this for you?"
   - **1-5:** Not urgent, probably won't pay
   - **6-7:** Moderate pain, might pay if cheap
   - **8-10:** Critical pain, will likely pay

8. "If this problem disappeared tomorrow, how would that impact your work?"
   - **Listen for:** Concrete outcomes (save X hours, publish Y more papers, etc.)

**Budget/Willingness to Pay:**
9. "Do you currently pay for any tools to help with this?"
   - **Listen for:** Whether they have budget allocated
   - **If yes:** "What do you pay for those?"

10. "If a tool could [SOLVE PROBLEM] for you, what would it be worth?"
    - **Listen for:** Dollar amounts, comparison to existing tools
    - **Follow-up:** "Would you pay that per month? Per use? One-time?"

#### Closing (3 min)
```
This has been super helpful, thank you.

A few last questions:

11. "Who else should I talk to who has this same problem?"
    - (Get 2-3 referrals - warm intros are gold)

12. "Would you be interested in trying an early version if I build something?"
    - If yes: "What would make you actually use it vs. just sign up and forget?"

13. "Can I follow up with you in a few weeks as I learn more?"

Thanks again [Name], this was incredibly valuable.

### Interview #2: Solution Validation (10-15 minutes)

**Goal:** Test if your proposed solution resonates

**ONLY do this interview after 10+ problem discovery interviews**

#### Introduction (1 min)
```
Hi [Name], thanks for chatting again. Last time we talked about [PAIN POINT].

I've been working on a potential solution and wanted to get your take on whether
it actually solves your problem.

Sound good?
```

#### Solution Presentation (2 min)
```
Here's the concept: [EXPLAIN IN 2-3 SENTENCES]

[SHOW: Wireframe, mockup, or simple prototype]

The key features would be:
1. [FEATURE 1]
2. [FEATURE 2]
3. [FEATURE 3]

[PAUSE - let them react]
```

#### Validation Questions (7 min)

1. "What's your first reaction?"
   - **Listen for:** Genuine excitement vs. polite interest
   - **Red flag:** "That's interesting" (= not interested)
   - **Green flag:** "When can I use this?"

2. "How would this fit into your current workflow?"
   - **Listen for:** Whether they can visualize using it

3. "What's missing? What would make this a must-have for you?"
   - **Listen for:** Critical features you didn't think of

4. "Would you use this instead of [CURRENT TOOL]?"
   - **Listen for:** Whether you're solving a real pain or nice-to-have

5. "If this cost $X/month, would you sign up today?"
   - **Test different price points:** $10, $25, $50, $99
   - **Listen for:** Immediate "yes" vs. "I'd have to think about it"

6. "Would you be willing to pre-pay 3 months at 50% off to get early access?"
   - **This is the REAL test** - do they put money down?
   - **If yes:** Get credit card info NOW
   - **If no:** Ask why not

#### Closing (2 min)
```
7. "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to use this when it launches?"
   - 9-10: "What would make it a 10?"
   - 6-8: "What's holding you back?"
   - 1-5: "What would need to change for you to consider it?"

8. "Can I add you to the beta list? I'll send you access in [TIMEFRAME]."

Thanks so much [Name], this really helps me build the right thing.
```

### Interview #3: Pricing Discovery (5-10 minutes)

**Goal:** Find the optimal price point

#### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Questions

Ask these 4 questions in order:

1. **Too Expensive (Upper Bound)**
   "At what price would you consider this too expensive to consider?"
   - Answer: $___

2. **Expensive but Worth It (Premium)**
   "At what price would you consider this expensive, but still worth considering?"
   - Answer: $___

3. **Good Value (Target)**
   "At what price would you consider this a good value for the money?"
   - Answer: $___

4. **Too Cheap (Lower Bound)**
   "At what price would you consider this too cheap, where you'd question the quality?"
   - Answer: $___

#### Analysis
After 20+ interviews, plot these on a chart. The optimal price is usually where "Expensive but Worth It" and "Good Value" intersect.

**Rule of thumb:**
- B2C SaaS: $10-50/month
- B2B SaaS (individual): $50-200/month
- B2B SaaS (team): $200-1000/month
- Academic tools: $10-30/month (low budgets)

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Everyone describes problem differently → poorly defined
- ❌ No one currently pays for solutions → no budget
- ❌ "That's interesting" but no urgency → nice-to-have
- ❌ Can't articulate specific pain → you're leading them

**Green flags:**
- ✅ Consistent pain point across 80%+ of interviews
- ✅ People already paying $X/month for partial solutions
- ✅ "When can I use this?" asked unprompted
- ✅ Referrals flow naturally ("You should talk to...")

## 🚨 Validation Decision Framework

After 30 interviews + pre-sale experiment, use this framework:

### GO Signals (Build It)
- ✅ 10+ people pre-paid OR 50%+ said "I'd pay $X/month today"
- ✅ Consistent pain point (8+/10 severity) across 70%+ of interviews
- ✅ People already paying for partial solutions
- ✅ Total addressable market: 10,000+ potential users
- ✅ Clear differentiation from existing tools

**Action:** Build MVP focusing on top 3 must-have features

---

### PIVOT Signals (Change Something)
- 🟡 <5 pre-sales but strong interest
- 🟡 Pain point exists but current solutions "good enough"
- 🟡 High variance in what people want
- 🟡 Willingness to pay much lower than cost to build

**Pivot options:**
1. **Different customer segment** (e.g., industry vs. academia)
2. **Different problem** (e.g., focus on subset of pain)
3. **Different solution** (e.g., service vs. software)
4. **Different business model** (e.g., freemium vs. paid)

**Action:** Do 10 more interviews with new approach

---

### STOP Signals (Don't Build)
- 🔴 0-1 pre-sales after asking 30+ people
- 🔴 Pain score <6/10 average
- 🔴 No one currently pays for solutions in this space
- 🔴 Total addressable market <1,000 users
- 🔴 "That's interesting" but no urgency

**Action:** Save yourself 6 months and $50K. Move to different idea.

**Remember:** Stopping is not failure. It's efficient learning.

## 🎓 Pro Tips

### 1. **Ask for Examples, Not Opinions**
❌ "Would you use a tool that does X?"
✅ "Tell me about the last time you struggled with X."

**Why:** People are bad at predicting behavior, good at describing past behavior.

---

### 2. **Listen for Emotion**
Strong signals:
- "It's so frustrating when..."
- "I hate having to..."
- "I wish I could just..."

Weak signals:
- "It would be nice if..."
- "I guess sometimes..."
- "Maybe occasionally..."

---

### 3. **The Mom Test**
Ask questions even your mom couldn't lie about:

❌ "Would you buy this?" (Everyone says yes to be nice)
✅ "What have you already tried to solve this?" (Can't fake past behavior)

---

### 4. **Follow the Money**
Best predictor of future payment = current payment

Ask:
- "What tools do you currently pay for?"
- "How much do you spend on [category] per month?"
- "Who controls the budget for this?"

---

### 5. **Get to "No" Fast**
Bad signals are GOOD DATA.

If 10/10 interviews show no pain → you just saved 6 months of building the wrong thing.

---
