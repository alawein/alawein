## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Can't get anyone to respond (after 20 emails)

**Solutions:**
1. **Offer incentive:** "$10 Amazon gift card for 15 minutes"
2. **Shorten email:** 3 sentences max
3. **Try warm intros:** Ask friends for introductions
4. **Different channel:** Twitter DMs, LinkedIn, Reddit DMs
5. **Better targeting:** Make sure you're emailing the RIGHT people

### Problem: Getting interviews but pain is weak (<6/10)

**Solutions:**
1. **Different segment:** Try senior vs. junior, industry vs. academia
2. **Different problem:** You might be solving wrong pain point
3. **Better questions:** Dig deeper with "Tell me about the last time that happened"
4. **Reframe:** Maybe it's a vitamin (nice-to-have) not a painkiller (must-have)

### Problem: Each person describes different problems

**Solutions:**
1. **Narrow targeting:** Be more specific about who you interview
2. **Identify sub-segments:** Maybe there are 2 different personas
3. **Find the core:** What's the underlying job-to-be-done?

### Problem: People say "interesting" but don't seem excited

**Red flag:** This is the "polite no" - they won't pay

**Solutions:**
1. **Probe deeper:** "On a scale of 1-10, how big is this problem?"
2. **Test urgency:** "If this was solved tomorrow, what would that enable?"
3. **Reality check:** They might not actually have the pain you think

### Problem: Hit Day 5 with only 3 interviews scheduled

**Emergency actions:**
1. **Send 20 more emails TODAY**
2. **Offer $15 gift card (not $10)**
3. **Post in 5 more communities**
4. **Ask everyone you know for warm intros**
5. **Extend Week 1 to 8 days if needed**

## 💪 MOTIVATION BOOSTERS

### When you want to quit (Day 2-3):
> "99% of people with ideas never send a single email. By sending 10, you're in the top 1%. By completing 1 interview, you're in the top 0.1%. Keep going."

### When you get rejections:
> "Every 'no' gets you closer to the right target market. Rejection is data, not failure."

### When interviews reveal weak pain:
> "Finding out there's no real pain in 1 week for $0 is a MASSIVE WIN. Most founders waste 6 months and $50K to learn this."

### When you're overwhelmed:
> "You only have ONE job this week: Schedule 10 interviews. Not build, not plan, not perfect. Just schedule 10 conversations. You've got this."

---

## 🎯 DAILY STANDUP (Do this every morning)

**3 questions:**
1. **Yesterday:** How many emails sent? Interviews done?
2. **Today:** What's my ONE goal? (e.g., "Complete 2 interviews")
3. **Blockers:** What might prevent me from hitting today's goal?

**Time:** 2 minutes
**Impact:** Keeps you focused and accountable
