## The Origin Story

### "Habibi, Here You Go. Now Leave Me Alone... Or Not."

This entire research automation suite exists because of one very persistent, very curious nephew.

Talal had questions. So. Many. Questions.

*"Why does this work like that?"*
*"But what if you tried...?"*
*"Can you make something that does...?"*

He didn't just ask once. He asked **constantly**. With that smile. That knowing, mischievous smile that says "I know you're going to build this for me because you can't resist a good challenge."

And he was right.

What started as simple answers became demonstrations. Demonstrations became prototypes. Prototypes became tools. Tools became systems. Systems became... this.

**14 research automation products.**
**~184,000 lines of code.**
**Automated idea generation, validation, and execution.**

All because I couldn't say no to a kid with robotic-AI-wizard energy who drove me absolutely crazy with his relentless curiosity.

So here it is, Talal.

**TalAI** - طلال

Your personal research automation suite. Named after you. Because you wouldn't leave me alone until I built something this ambitious.

*Habibi, here you go.*

Now... are you satisfied? Or do you have more questions?

*(I know you do.)*
