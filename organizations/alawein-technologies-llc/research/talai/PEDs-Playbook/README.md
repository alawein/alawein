This folder consolidates all former sub-projects under `PEDs-Monetization/projects` into a single, cleaned project.

Highlights:

- Nested Git histories were removed.
- Duplicate files resolved by preferring the most recently modified version.

Files:
- `duplicate-resolutions.txt` – log of how duplicates were resolved.

Conventions:
- Keep new content under `src/`, docs under `docs/`, data under `data/`, and generated artifacts under `outputs/`.
