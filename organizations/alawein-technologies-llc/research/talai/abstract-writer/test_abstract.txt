Recent advances in neural architecture search have highlighted computational overhead of existing NAS methods, creating new opportunities for neural architecture search systems. This is particularly relevant in contexts where computational overhead of existing NAS methods limits effectiveness. Yet, However, existing approaches suffer from prohibitive search costs for edge deployment, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To address this We propose EdgeNAS, combining progressive search with hardware feedback and adaptive optimization to overcome existing constraints. Our framework enables robust processing. Results indicate that Experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and custom edge benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves inference latency and accuracy of 97.6%, outperforming baseline methods by 16.6%. This approach This approach has significant potential for mobile and IoT applications, particularly in mobile and IoT applications scenarios.
