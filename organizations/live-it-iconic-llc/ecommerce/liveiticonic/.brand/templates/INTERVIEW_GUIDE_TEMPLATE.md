## Interview Techniques (How to Be a Good Interviewer)

### Do's

✅ **Listen actively**
- Don't just wait for your turn to talk
- Follow interesting threads even if not on your list

✅ **Embrace silence**
- Let them think
- Pauses often lead to deeper thoughts

✅ **Ask "why" and "how"**
- Open-ended questions get better stories
- "Tell me about..." is better than "Did you...?"

✅ **Mirror their energy**
- If they're excited, match it
- If they're reflective, slow down

✅ **Make eye contact**
- Look at them, not the camera
- Makes it feel like a real conversation

✅ **Show genuine curiosity**
- Your interest makes them more comfortable
- Authentic reactions ("Wow, really?" "That's incredible") are good

✅ **Follow up on good answers**
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What was that like?"
- "How did that feel?"

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't interrupt**
- Let them finish thoughts
- Silence is okay

❌ **Don't lead with your own stories**
- This is their moment
- Save your anecdotes for building rapport off-camera

❌ **Don't rush**
- Let conversation breathe
- The best moments often come when you slow down

❌ **Don't ask yes/no questions**
- Bad: "Did you enjoy restoring it?"
- Good: "What was the restoration process like for you?"

❌ **Don't be afraid to re-do answers**
- If they give a short or unclear answer, ask again differently
- "That's interesting—can you expand on that?"

## Red Flags (When to Pause or Re-Evaluate)

**If guest seems:**
- Uncomfortable or nervous → Take a break, reassure them, try again
- Giving short answers → Ask more open-ended follow-ups, share your own curiosity
- Going off on tangents → Gently redirect: "That's interesting—let's come back to [topic]"
- Sharing something sensitive → Check in: "Are you comfortable with this being public?"

**If technical issues:**
- Audio problems → Stop, fix, re-record
- Lighting problems → Adjust or move location
- Background noise → Pause until it passes, or move

## Example Interview Transcript Snippet (For Reference)

**Interviewer:** "Tell me about the moment you decided to buy this car."

**Guest:** "Oh man, I remember it so clearly. I was scrolling Instagram late at night—like way too late, probably 2 AM—and I saw it pop up for sale. And I just… I knew. I called the seller the next morning before I even had coffee. My wife thought I was crazy."

**Interviewer:** "What was it that made you so certain?"

**Guest:** "I think it was because I'd been dreaming about this exact car since I was 16. I had a poster of it on my wall. And here it was, same color, same year, everything. It felt like fate, you know? Like if I didn't jump on it right then, I'd regret it forever."

**Interviewer:** "And did you? Have any regrets?"

**Guest:** *[laughs]* "Not a single one. Best impulse decision I've ever made."
