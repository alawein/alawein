## 🎯 Decision Points

**Before Launch:** Are both founders 100% committed to 12 months?

**Month 3:** Is engagement good? (Comments, shares, sales?)

**Month 6:** Revenue covering costs? Growth positive?

**Month 12:** Scale or maintain?

If engagement/sales are poor by Month 3, you can pivot the content strategy. But give it 3 months minimum.

---

## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

**1. Consistency (Non-Negotiable)**
- 2 YouTube videos per week
- Same day/time for Twitch
- Regular social media posts
- Consistency beats quality

**2. Authenticity**
- Real guests (not bought followers)
- Genuine conversations
- Premium products
- True brand voice

**3. Community First**
- Reply to EVERY comment (months 1-6)
- Build email list
- Create engagement opportunities
- Make people feel part of something

**4. Patience**
- Week 1-4: Feels like nobody's watching
- Month 2: Slow growth
- Month 3: Momentum starts
- Month 6: Real traction

If you're consistent for 6 months, growth becomes inevitable.

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Should we do both YouTube and Twitch?**
A: YouTube is primary (more discovery). Twitch is bonus (better engagement). Do YouTube consistently, add Twitch when ready.

**Q: How much equipment do we need?**
A: Phone + ring light + USB mic = $150 total. Upgrade later.

**Q: When do we make money?**
A: Month 4-6 from YouTube ads. Month 3 from merch (if you push). Month 6+ from sponsorships.

**Q: What if the first video gets 0 views?**
A: Normal. Share it with friends/network. By video 10 you'll have momentum.

**Q: Should we do daily posts?**
A: No. 2-3x per week is sustainable. Consistency > frequency.

**Q: Do we need fancy thumbnails?**
A: Yes. Thumbnails are 30% of clicks. Invest here.

**Q: When do we hire help?**
A: Month 6 when you're drowning. Editor first, then admin.

**Q: Is this going to work?**
A: If you stay consistent for 6 months and the community responds, yes. The model is proven. The bottleneck is execution.

## 💡 Key Insight

**The biggest mistake people make is treating this like a hobby for 3 months, then wondering why it doesn't work.**

This requires commitment:
- 40-50 hours/week for 6 months (both founders)
- Posting schedule you actually keep
- Guest curation that's genuinely interesting
- Products that are actually premium
- Community engagement that feels real

**If you do this, it will work. If you half-ass it, it won't.**

Make the decision now: Are you committed to 6 months of real effort?

If yes → read the guides, execute the plan, build the business
If no → don't start (there are easier ways to make money)

## Final Thoughts

You have:
- ✅ Built website
- ✅ Product ready
- ✅ Multiple revenue models
- ✅ Audience in mind
- ✅ Detailed playbook
- ✅ Technical setup
- ✅ Financial projections

**The only thing missing is execution.**

This isn't speculative. The model is proven by thousands of successful creators. The demand exists. The tools are cheap. The barriers are low.

Your advantage: You're starting with a co-founder (reduces burnout), you have a real product (not just content), and you have a clear playbook.

**Stop planning. Start shipping.**

Make your first video. Upload it. See what happens.

The business becomes obvious once you start.
