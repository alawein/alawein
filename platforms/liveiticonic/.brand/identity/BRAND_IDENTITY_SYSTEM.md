## 📐 Design Principles

### 1. Elegant Minimalism
**What it means:** Clean lines, generous whitespace, focus on essential elements
**What it's not:** Stark coldness or boring simplicity

**Application:**
- Remove everything that doesn't serve a purpose
- Use whitespace intentionally (not accidentally)
- Let content breathe
- One focal point per screen/section

### 2. Premium Without Pretension
**What it means:** High-quality execution that's welcoming, not gatekeeping
**What it's not:** Luxury that intimidates or generic that cheapens

**Application:**
- Materials feel premium (quality photos, clean design)
- Tone is approachable ("we're having a conversation")
- Price is accessible ($29-79, not $500+)
- Anyone can join the community

### 3. Automotive Precision
**What it means:** Attention to detail, craftsmanship, engineering mindset
**What it's not:** Over-engineering or technical jargon

**Application:**
- Pixel-perfect alignment
- Consistent spacing (8pt grid)
- Purposeful color choices
- Clean, functional interfaces

### 4. Human-Centered Storytelling
**What it means:** Every design choice serves the story being told
**What it's not:** Flashy effects or design for design's sake

**Application:**
- Photos feature people, not just products
- Copy focuses on experience, not specs
- Videos prioritize conversation over production
- Community comes before aesthetics

## 🎬 Photography Style

### Guidelines
- **Focus:** People in their element (not posed studio shots)
- **Lighting:** Natural, warm, golden hour when possible
- **Composition:** Rule of thirds, leading lines, depth
- **Color Grade:** Slightly warm, rich blacks, subtle saturation boost
- **Mood:** Aspirational but authentic (not overly filtered)

### What to Capture
- **Products:** In use, lifestyle context, detail shots
- **People:** Genuine expressions, candid moments, environmental portraits
- **Cars:** Dynamic angles, detail shots, human interaction
- **Lifestyle:** Experiences, locations, moments that matter

### What to Avoid
- Stock photo aesthetics
- Over-processed HDR look
- Artificial studio lighting
- Generic poses

## 🎥 Video Style

### Aesthetic
- **Camera:** Smooth, stable (gimbal or tripod)
- **Framing:** Cinematic 16:9, rule of thirds
- **Editing:** Clean cuts, no flashy transitions
- **Color:** Warm, rich, slightly desaturated (not overly vibrant)
- **Audio:** Clear, balanced, no background noise

### Interview Format
- **Setup:** Two-person conversation, both visible or switching between
- **Background:** Blurred or intentional (garage, office, car interior)
- **Lighting:** Soft, flattering, three-point when possible
- **Duration:** 8-12 minutes (sweet spot for retention)

### B-Roll Style
- **Car footage:** Dynamic driving shots, detail pans, ambient
- **Lifestyle:** Hands interacting with products, environment establishing shots
- **Pacing:** Matches music tempo, not too fast or slow
