## Pre-Production Workflow

### Step 1: Guest Identification & Outreach (Week 1-2 Before Filming)

**Objective:** Secure interesting guests with compelling stories

**Process:**

1. **Identify Potential Guests**
   - Source from: Local car clubs, Instagram, Cars & Coffee events, referrals
   - Criteria:
     - [ ] Has an interesting car(s)
     - [ ] Has a compelling story (why they collect/build)
     - [ ] Comfortable on camera (or willing to try)
     - [ ] Geographically accessible (within 2 hours drive initially)

2. **Initial Outreach (Email or DM)**
   ```
   Template:

   Subject: Feature Your [Car] Story on Live It Iconic?

   Hi [Name],

   I'm [Your Name] from Live It Iconic—a YouTube channel focused on the stories
   behind automotive passion. I came across your [car/build/collection] and
   would love to feature you in a conversation-style video.

   The format is simple: 8-12 minute conversation about your story, why this car
   matters to you, and what drives your passion. It's not about specs—it's about you.

   Filming takes about 90 minutes, and I handle all editing. Would you be interested?

   Best,
   [Your Name]
   Live It Iconic
   ```

3. **Follow-Up**
   - If no response in 5 days, send one follow-up
   - If no response after follow-up, archive and move to next guest

4. **Confirmation & Scheduling**
   - Once interested, send calendar link (Calendly or similar)
   - Confirm date, time, location
   - Send pre-interview questionnaire (see below)

---

### Step 2: Pre-Interview Research (3-5 Days Before Filming)

**Objective:** Prepare compelling questions and understand the guest's story

**Process:**

1. **Review Pre-Interview Questionnaire**
   - Guest completes form covering:
     - Car history (how they got it, modifications, significance)
     - Personal story (why cars matter to them)
     - Unique angles (surprising facts, challenges overcome)

2. **Additional Research**
   - [ ] Google the guest (background, profession, interests)
   - [ ] Review their social media (Instagram, forum posts)
   - [ ] Research the specific car (if it's rare or unique)
   - [ ] Note any recent builds/events they've been involved in

3. **Prepare Question List**
   - Write 10-15 open-ended questions
   - Focus on "why" not "what"
   - Include personal stories, emotions, challenges
   - Plan 2-3 "surprise" questions (deeper, unexpected)

**Sample Questions:**
- "What's the first car you remember falling in love with?"
- "Walk me through the moment you decided to buy/build this car."
- "What's one thing about this car that most people don't notice?"
- "If this car could talk, what would it say about you?"
- "What's the biggest lesson this car has taught you?"

---

### Step 3: Location Scouting & Logistics (2-3 Days Before)

**Objective:** Ensure filming location is optimal

**Checklist:**

- [ ] **Confirm Location**
  - Guest's garage, driveway, or public location (Cars & Coffee, scenic area)
  - Check for parking, power access, restrooms

- [ ] **Lighting Check**
  - Best time of day: Golden hour (1-2 hours before sunset)
  - Backup plan: Overcast day or use portable LED panels
  - Avoid harsh midday sun

- [ ] **Audio Check**
  - Minimize background noise (traffic, lawn mowers, construction)
  - Have backup location if primary is too noisy

- [ ] **Backup Plan**
  - Weather contingency (reschedule if heavy rain)
  - Indoor location option (inside garage with door open)

3. **Audio Test**

   - [ ] Adjust levels if needed

4. **Make Guest Comfortable**

   - If a response is especially good, ask them to repeat it slightly differently
   - Gives editing options later

### Step 2: Rough Cut (Day 1-2 After Filming)

   - Cut out filler, "um"s, long pauses (keep natural pauses)
   - Total interview length: 6-9 minutes

2. **Story Arc**
   - **Opening (0:00-0:30):** Hook—best moment or intriguing quote
   - **Introduction (0:30-1:00):** Who is this person? What car?
   - **Body (1:00-7:00):** Their story, the journey, the why
   - **Closing (7:00-8:00):** Reflection, advice, what's next

3. **Add B-Roll**
   - Layer B-roll over interview to cover jump cuts
   - Match B-roll to what's being discussed

   - Music should enhance emotion, not distract
   - Lower music during speech, raise during B-roll only

4. **Graphics & Text**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** Guest is nervous on camera
- **Solution:** Reassure them, start with easy questions, remind them it's a conversation, do a practice run

**Issue:** Poor audio (wind, traffic noise)
- **Solution:** Move to quieter location, use windscreen, record voice-over later if needed

**Issue:** Bad lighting (harsh sun, too dark)
- **Solution:** Move to shade, use LED panels, shoot during golden hour, reschedule if necessary

**Issue:** Guest gives short, uninteresting answers
- **Solution:** Ask follow-up questions ("Tell me more about that"), use "why" and "how" questions, share a personal story to model openness

**Issue:** Video feels boring during edit
- **Solution:** Tighten pacing (cut more), use dynamic B-roll, add music, restructure story arc (start with best moment)

**Issue:** Low views after publishing
- **Solution:** Improve thumbnail (test new design), optimize title (more clickable), promote more aggressively, analyze retention curve (where do people drop off?)

---

At the end of each month, review:

- [ ] **Performance:** Which videos performed best? Why?
