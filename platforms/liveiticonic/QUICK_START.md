## 🎯 Core Brand Message (Lock This In)

**You are a lifestyle brand. Not a merch company.**

Your merch (cap, hoodie, shirt) is a byproduct of the lifestyle content you create.

**What You Actually Sell:**
- Interviews with interesting people
- A point of view on automotive culture
- Community of like-minded people
- Premium aesthetic + taste

**Merch is Secondary** - It's the proof point that you're building something real.

---

## 📱 Social Media Posting Schedule (Easy)

Once you're live, do this weekly:

**Monday-Friday:**
- 1 Instagram post (Reel or carousel)
- 1 TikTok video (or repurpose Instagram)
- Random Twitter thoughts

**Thursday AM:**
- Publish YouTube video

**Friday PM:**
- Email newsletter (what you've learned, what's next)

**Sunday:**
- Plan next week

---

## 🎬 Content Pillars (Remember)

60% INTERVIEWS | 25% CARS | 10% PRODUCTS | 5% BRAND

**That's it.** Stick to this ratio and you'll have a coherent brand.

---

## 💰 Realistic Timeline

| Milestone | Timeline | Indicator |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Website + First Post | Week 1-2 | You feel proud sharing link |
| First YouTube Video | Week 3-4 | 20+ views, 1-2 comments |
| 100 Email Subscribers | Month 2 | People actually interested |
| First Product Sale | Month 2-3 | Someone paid real money |
| 1K YouTube Subs | Month 3-6 | Consistent weekly uploads |
| $1K Revenue/Month | Month 6-9 | Real sustainable business |

**This is not get-rich-quick. This is build-something-real.**

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

**DON'T:**
- Overthink the first video (good enough beats perfect)
- Wait for perfect equipment (phone camera is fine)
- Post sporadically (consistency matters more)
- Only promote yourself (build community first)
- Sell products before brand trust (hard to convert)
- Compare to established creators (they took years)

**DO:**
- Start with people you know (lower pressure)
- Keep videos tight (20-25 min is ideal)
- Engage with every comment (you're building a community)
- Be authentic (people smell bullshit)
- Have fun (if you're not enjoying this, it shows)

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need fancy equipment?**
A: No. iPhone + good lighting + good mic. That's it. Start there.

**Q: How long should videos be?**
A: YouTube interviews: 20-25 min. TikTok/Reels: 60 sec max. Website: varies.

**Q: Should I do daily posts?**
A: No. 2-3x per week is sustainable and Google/TikTok rewards consistency over volume.

**Q: When should I ask about sponsorships?**
A: Month 6+. Get 5K+ followers first.

**Q: What if nobody watches?**
A: Weeks 1-2 are always quiet. By week 4 you'll know if it's resonating. If not, adjust the content, not the brand.

**Q: Do I need to hire an editor?**
A: Month 1-2, you edit. Month 3+, consider outsourcing (costs ~$20-50 per video).

**Q: What's the deal with Twitch?**
A: Optional but recommended. Stream the interviews live on Twitch, then upload edited version to YouTube. Builds community faster.

**Q: When do I make money?**
A: Month 1-3 is investment. Month 3-6 is when you start seeing real revenue from products + ads.

## 🎬 First Interview Script (Keep it Simple)

**Intro (2 min):**
"Hey everyone, I'm [name]. This is Live It Iconic, where we talk to interesting people about the automotive lifestyle and what iconic really means. Today I'm talking to [guest name]..."

**Main (15-20 min):**
"So [guest], tell us... how did you get into [cars/this lifestyle]?"
(Ask 3-5 follow-up questions. Listen more than you talk.)

**Wrap (3 min):**
"Before we go, I want to show you something..."
(Hold up one Live It Iconic product)
"We make these for people who actually live the lifestyle..."
"If you want one, link is in the description"

**Outro (1 min):**
"Thanks [guest] for coming. If you liked this, subscribe, that helps us a lot."
(End with energy, smile)

---

## 🚀 Starting Tomorrow

1. **Message 3 people** - "Hey, I'm starting a YouTube channel about [cars/lifestyle]. Want to be my first guest?" (Make it easy for them)

2. **Set up YouTube** - Create channel, upload profile pic, write description

3. **Create a "Coming Soon" post** - Instagram/TikTok: "YouTube launches Friday. First interview with [name]. Follow for launch"

4. **Block calendar** - When will you record? When will you edit? Treat it like appointments.

That's it. That's the start.

## 🎯 Your North Star

"We're not a merchandise company. We're a lifestyle community that happens to make merch."

Keep that in mind in every decision.

**Everything serves the story. The merch serves the community. The community serves the vision.**

---

## Let's Go

You have everything you need. The brand foundation is solid. The website is ready. The content strategy is planned.

Now you just have to execute.

Week 1 is all about getting comfortable on camera and in the brand voice. You'll feel awkward. That's normal. Week 3 you'll find your groove.

By Week 4 launch, you'll be ready.

**You've got this.**

Let me know when you have questions.
