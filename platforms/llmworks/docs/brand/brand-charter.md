# Aegis AI — Brand Charter

Last updated: {DATE}

1. Mission
Enable safer, more reliable AI by making model evaluation transparent, rigorous, and accessible.

2. Vision
A global standard for evaluating AI systems where qualitative insight and quantitative rigor converge, guiding responsible deployment across research and industry.

3. Core Principles
- Safety First: Every decision optimizes for downstream safety and risk reduction.
- Transparency & Auditability: All evaluations create traceable, explainable artifacts.
- Reproducibility & Rigor: Methods are documented, repeatable, and peer-review friendly.
- Human‑Centered: Tools empower practitioners and respect user context and intent.
- Responsible Innovation: Advance capabilities without compromising ethics or compliance.
- Privacy & Security by Design: Protect data, credentials, and model IP at every step.
- Accessibility & Inclusion: WCAG‑aligned experiences and inclusive language by default.

4. Positioning
For AI researchers, ML engineers, and product teams who need to trust model behavior, Aegis AI is the evaluation platform that unifies interactive testing (The Arena) with rigorous benchmarking (The Bench). Unlike general-purpose sandboxes or static leaderboards, Aegis provides end‑to‑end auditable workflows, bias mitigation, and longitudinal performance tracking.

5. Key Differentiators
- Dual‑workspace model: The Arena (qualitative) + The Bench (quantitative)
- Arbiter + Verifier Framework: Bias mitigation and factual/math/code verification
- Dynamic Elo + Standard Benchmarks: Relative and absolute performance in one place
- Structured Audit Trails: Judge rationales, citations, parameters, and outcomes
- Design System Excellence: HSL tokens, light/dark themes, a11y‑first components
- Open Integrations: Pluggable models, datasets, and storage; Supabase foundation

6. Messaging Pillars (with proof points)
- Trust & Safety: Bias controls, transparent judging, verifiable outputs
- Rigor & Reproducibility: Benchmarks, datasets, seeded runs, report exports
- Insight & Velocity: Multi‑agent experiments reveal failure modes faster
- Control & Compliance: Role‑based access patterns, audit logs, exportable evidence

7. Narrative & Boilerplate
Aegis AI is the shield for responsible AI—combining interactive exploration with standardized evaluation to illuminate how models think and how they perform.

8. Tagline Options
- The shield of AI evaluation
- Evaluate with confidence
- Where AI performance meets accountability

9. Voice & Tone (summary)
- Voice: Clear, credible, and human. Avoid hype; favor evidence.
- Tone: Adjust by context—product UI (concise/neutral), docs (helpful/precise), marketing (confident/inspiring), errors (empathetic/solution‑oriented).

10. Copy Patterns (examples)
- Home H1: Evaluate AI models with confidence
  Subhead: Unite interactive testing and rigorous benchmarking to understand, compare, and trust model behavior.
  Primary CTA: Open Dashboard

12. Accessibility & Motion
- Respect prefers‑reduced‑motion; provide focus states and sufficient contrast
- Use semantic HTML landmarks and a single H1 per page

13. Competitive Context (snapshot)
- Leaderboards: static snapshots vs. Aegis longitudinal + interactive
- Prompt sandboxes: single‑agent demos vs. Aegis multi‑agent orchestration
- Enterprise eval tools: closed black boxes vs. Aegis auditable and integrable

14. Compliance & Ethics (starter)
- Document evaluation data sources and licensing
- Provide clear disclaimers for synthetic judgments
- Offer data deletion and export flows

15. Success Metrics
- Time‑to‑insight (create → run → interpret)
- Evaluation repeatability rate
- Benchmark report exports and shares
- Model comparison engagement
