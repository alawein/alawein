## Follow-up Email Series

### Email 2: Feature Deep Dive (Send 3 days after announcement)
```html
Subject: Deep dive: How LLM Works transforms model evaluation

Hi [FirstName],

Following up on our LLM Works announcement, I wanted to share how our evaluation framework can transform your approach to model selection and monitoring.

## The Problem with Ad-Hoc Evaluation

Most teams evaluate LLMs inconsistently:
❌ Different criteria each time  
❌ No audit trail for decisions  
❌ Results that can't be reproduced  
❌ No systematic comparison method  

## Our Solution: Systematic Evaluation

**🏛️ Arbiter Framework**
Consistent evaluation protocols ensure fair, unbiased assessment every time.

**🔍 Verifier System**  
Cryptographic proofs make every result auditable and tamper-evident.

**📊 Dynamic Elo Rankings**
Real-time performance tracking based on head-to-head comparisons.

## See It in Action

**Case Study**: A fintech company used LLM Works to evaluate 5 models for customer service. The Arena revealed GPT-4 excelled at complex queries but Claude-3 was better for routine questions. They deployed a hybrid approach, improving customer satisfaction 23%.

**Your turn**: Try comparing two models in The Arena. Takes 5 minutes and might change how you think about model selection.
