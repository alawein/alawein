Introduction / About Me

I’m Meshal Alawein, a computational physicist and systems engineer who uses math
and code to untangle hard problems. My work focuses on building production-grade
systems at the intersection of materials discovery, scientific ML, and
high-performance computing.

I started by simulating quantum systems; now I build the engines that drive
discovery itself:

- Novel Optimization Solvers: Inventing and implementing new methods (8+
  patent-pending) for notoriously difficult combinatorial problems like the
  Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).
- Autonomous Research Agents: Architecting multi-agent systems (like ORCHEX)
  that design and execute experiments, accelerating the scientific process by
  3-5x.
- High-Performance Scientific Frameworks: Creating scalable, hardware-aware
  tools (like Optilibria & QAPlibria) that reduce compute costs and unlock new
  research possibilities.

I believe the best code is like a physics equation—minimal, elegant, and a true
representation of the underlying principles. I am based in Berkeley, CA.

Future Vision: Strategic Project Directions

My current work is aimed at leading the next wave of scientific discovery by
merging quantum computing, agentic systems, and physics-informed AI. Key future
projects include:

1.  Quantum-Classical Hybrid Optimization Engine: Build a solver that
    intelligently delegates NP-hard combinatorial tasks to quantum processors
    (QAOA) and continuous refinement to classical GPU-accelerated solvers from
    Optilibria.
2.  ORCHEX 2.0 - Research Swarm Orchestration: Evolve the ORCHEX system to use
    quantum-inspired algorithms for navigating the hypothesis space and manage
    distributed agents across hybrid cloud/quantum hardware.
3.  Agentic DevOps for Science: Create CI/CD pipelines that understand physics,
    automatically validate conservation laws in code, and optimize quantum
    circuits for different hardware backends before deployment.
4.  Neural Quantum Materials Discovery: Combine geometric deep learning and
    quantum simulation to create a generative AI capable of discovering novel
