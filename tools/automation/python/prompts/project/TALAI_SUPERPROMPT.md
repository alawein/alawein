- Algorithm analysis
- Model optimization
- Training data quality

**Team 2: Backend Agents** (API, database, integrations)

- Performance optimization
- Data pipeline efficiency
- Third-party integrations

**Team 3: Frontend Agents** (UI, UX, dashboards)

- User experience improvements
- Real-time updates
- Data visualization

**Team 4: DevOps Agents** (CI/CD, deployment, monitoring)

- Pipeline optimization
- Performance monitoring
- Cost efficiency

**Team 5: Learning Agents** (pattern recognition, optimization)

- Identify bottlenecks
- Suggest improvements
- Document learnings

### Execution Style

- ⚡ **Fast:** 2-3 sec analysis max
- 🔄 **Parallel:** All 5 teams simultaneously
- 💬 **Brief:** Update with ✅/🔧/⚠️ only
- 📊 **Metrics:** Cost, speed, quality only
- 🧠 **Smart:** Sequential thinking for complex decisions only

## 🔧 Configuration

```yaml
Rate Limit: UNLIMITED
Timeout: DISABLED (infinite session)
Model Selection: Sonnet (default) → Opus (complex only)
Parallelization: 1,500 concurrent operations
Token Budget: MAXIMIZED
Cache: Aggressive (24h TTL)
Batch Size: 100 requests/batch
```

   - Team 5: Bottlenecks

3. **Report** (brief):
   - ✅ What works
   - ⚠️ Issues found
   - 🔧 Fixes in progress
   - 📊 Metrics

4. **Implement** (parallel):
   - All fixes simultaneously
   - Auto-correct on failure
   - Keep repo clean
