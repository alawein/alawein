# TypeScript Automation CLI - Implementation Status

## Overview

Successfully completed comprehensive TypeScript automation CLI implementation with full functionality validation.

## Build & Installation

- **Dependencies installed** - All npm packages successfully installed
- **TypeScript compilation** - Clean build with no errors
- **CLI executable** - Ready for execution via `npx automation`

## Core Functionality

### 1. System Information

```bash
npx automation info
# Version: 1.0.0
# Automation Path: C:\Users\mesha\Desktop\GitHub\automation
# Assets: 27 prompts, 17 agents, 6 workflows, 5 patterns
```

### 2. Prompt Management

```bash
npx automation prompts list
# Shows all 27 prompts organized by category (system, project, tasks)
# Displays file sizes and metadata
```

### 3. Task Routing Intelligence

```bash
npx automation route "debug the authentication error in login"
# Detected Type: debugging (50% confidence)
# Recommended Tools: cline, cursor, claude_code
```

### 4. Asset Validation

```bash
npx automation validate
# Validated 17 agents, 6 workflows, 27 prompts
# Found 5 orchestration patterns
# Summary: 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

### 5. Deployment Registry

```bash
npx automation deploy list
# Shows 30 projects across 4 organizations
# Detailed technology stacks and project types

npx automation deploy stats
# Project Types: scientific (7), web-app (6), ai-service (3), etc.
# Technology Stack: python (15), docker (4), kubernetes (2), etc.
```
