### DEBT-87383DFB: Refactor Complex Code: Deeply nested code detected

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Hours:** 2  
**File:** `claude_http_integration.py`  
**Line:** 63

**Description:**
**Technical Debt Item:** Deeply nested code detected
**Location:** claude_http_integration.py:63
**Business Impact:** Difficult to understand and maintain

This code complexity issue makes the code difficult to understand, maintain, and test.
Complex code is a common source of bugs and makes onboarding new developers challenging.

**Remediation Strategy:**
Break down complex logic into smaller, focused functions with clear responsibilities.

**Step-by-Step Remediation:**

1. Analyze the complex code section to identify distinct responsibilities
2. Extract logical units into separate, well-named functions
3. Reduce nesting levels by using early returns or guard clauses
4. Add clear comments explaining the business logic
5. Ensure each function has a single, clear purpose
6. Run existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved

**Verification Steps:**

- [ ] Code complexity metrics should decrease (cyclomatic complexity)
- [ ] Function names should clearly describe their purpose
- [ ] Nesting levels should be reduced to ≤ 3 levels
- [ ] All existing tests should pass
- [ ] Code should be more readable and understandable

**Code Examples:**

##### Extract Complex Logic

**Before:**

```python
def process_data(data, options, config, settings):
    if data is not None:
        if options.get('validate', False):
            if config.get('strict', True):
                for item in data:
                    if item.get('active', True):
                        if settings.get('check_permissions', True):
                            if item.get('permission', 'read') == 'write':
                                # Complex nested logic here
                                pass
```

**After:**

```python
def process_data(data, options, config, settings):
    if not data:
        return []

    if not should_validate_data(options, config):
        return filter_active_items(data, settings)

    return validate_and_process_items(data, settings)

def should_validate_data(options, config):
    return options.get('validate', False) and config.get('strict', True)

def filter_active_items(data, settings):
    return [item for item in data
            if item.get('active', True) and
               has_write_permission(item, settings)]

def has_write_permission(item, settings):
    return (settings.get('check_permissions', True) and
            item.get('permission', 'read') == 'write')
```

### DEBT-66DF3CB4: Refactor Complex Code: Deeply nested code detected

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Hours:** 2  
**File:** `claude_http_integration.py`  
**Line:** 87

**Description:**
**Technical Debt Item:** Deeply nested code detected
**Location:** claude_http_integration.py:87
**Business Impact:** Difficult to understand and maintain

This code complexity issue makes the code difficult to understand, maintain, and test.
Complex code is a common source of bugs and makes onboarding new developers challenging.

**Remediation Strategy:**
Break down complex logic into smaller, focused functions with clear responsibilities.

**Step-by-Step Remediation:**

1. Analyze the complex code section to identify distinct responsibilities
2. Extract logical units into separate, well-named functions
3. Reduce nesting levels by using early returns or guard clauses
4. Add clear comments explaining the business logic
5. Ensure each function has a single, clear purpose
6. Run existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved

**Verification Steps:**

- [ ] Code complexity metrics should decrease (cyclomatic complexity)
- [ ] Function names should clearly describe their purpose
- [ ] Nesting levels should be reduced to ≤ 3 levels
- [ ] All existing tests should pass
- [ ] Code should be more readable and understandable

**Code Examples:**

##### Extract Complex Logic

**Before:**

```python
def process_data(data, options, config, settings):
    if data is not None:
        if options.get('validate', False):
            if config.get('strict', True):
                for item in data:
                    if item.get('active', True):
                        if settings.get('check_permissions', True):
                            if item.get('permission', 'read') == 'write':
                                # Complex nested logic here
                                pass
```

**After:**

```python
def process_data(data, options, config, settings):
    if not data:
        return []

    if not should_validate_data(options, config):
        return filter_active_items(data, settings)

    return validate_and_process_items(data, settings)

def should_validate_data(options, config):
    return options.get('validate', False) and config.get('strict', True)

def filter_active_items(data, settings):
    return [item for item in data
            if item.get('active', True) and
               has_write_permission(item, settings)]

def has_write_permission(item, settings):
    return (settings.get('check_permissions', True) and
            item.get('permission', 'read') == 'write')
```
