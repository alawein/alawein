Refactor code with focus on:

### Refactoring Goals
- Improve readability
- Reduce complexity
- Eliminate duplication
- Enhance maintainability

### Refactoring Strategy
1. **Understand**: Read and comprehend code
2. **Test**: Ensure tests exist
3. **Refactor**: Make incremental changes
4. **Validate**: Run tests after each change
5. **Review**: Check improvements

### Common Refactorings
- Extract method/function
- Rename for clarity
- Remove dead code
- Simplify conditionals
- Reduce nesting

### Safety Measures
- Run tests frequently
- Make small changes
- Commit often
- Keep behavior unchanged

### Quality Metrics
- Cyclomatic complexity: < 10
- Function length: < 50 lines
- Duplication: < 5%
- Test coverage: > 80%
```
